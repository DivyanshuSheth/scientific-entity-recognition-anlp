Summary : 
 
  This paper presents a proposition - level pipeline for multi - document summarization . The proposed method includes a salience model , clustering of propositions , fusion of cluster propositions , and generation of summary sentences . The method outperforms state - of - the - art baselines in terms of ROUGE scores and human evaluation metrics on the DUC 2004 and TAC 2011 datasets . The approach also provides " explanations " for each generated sentence by linking them to groups of propositions from which they were derived . The results show that the generated summary sentences are faithful to their corresponding clusters . The paper highlights the potential of proposition - level units for cleaner and more accurate summarization . Ethical considerations were taken into account , such as fair compensation for crowdworkers and adherence to NIST guidelines for acquiring datasets .
