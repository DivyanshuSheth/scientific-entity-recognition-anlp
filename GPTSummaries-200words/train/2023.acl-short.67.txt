Summary:

The research paper presents a novel unsupervised approach to subtitle segmentation using pretrained masked language models. The approach predicts line endings and subtitle breaks based on the likelihood of punctuation marks occurring at candidate segmentation points. The proposed method achieved competitive segmentation accuracy across metrics and fully preserved the original text. The evaluation was conducted on the MuST-Cinema corpus, and the results were compared with baseline models and supervised approaches. The evaluation metrics used were Sigma (ratio of achieved BLEU over an upper-bound BLEU score), break coverage, and length conformity. The proposed method outperformed the baseline model and provided a robust off-the-shelf solution for subtitle segmentation. The limitations of the approach and potential future directions are discussed. The evaluation results, including BLEU scores and break coverage, are provided for different languages and hyperparameter settings. The ethical considerations regarding energy consumption and training costs are also addressed.
