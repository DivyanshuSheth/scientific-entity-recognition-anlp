This research paper focuses on evaluating the faithfulness of abstractive summarization systems . The authors propose a framework for evaluating the effective faithfulness of summarization systems by generating a trade - off curve between faithfulness and abstractiveness . They show that recent methods for improving faithfulness mainly rely on increased extractiveness . They then propose a system that can select the most abstractive and faithful summary from a set of candidate summaries . This system outperforms the baseline system in terms of both abstractiveness and faithfulness on two datasets . The authors also introduce a selector model that achieves better effective faithfulness than the baseline model and other existing methods . The study is conducted on two English abstractive summarization datasets , Gigaword and Wikihow . The metrics used to evaluate faithfulness include coverage and density . The results show a positive correlation between extractiveness and faithfulness scores . The paper concludes by discussing the implications and limitations of the study .
