Summary:

The paper presents a data augmentation method called Counterfactual data Augmentation method via Perspective Transition (CAPT) to automatically augment high-quality responses with different semantics for open-domain dialogue systems. CAPT uses counterfactual inference to generate semantically different responses by replacing the observed reply perspective with valid alternatives, while keeping the current environment unchanged. The authors build a shift graph based on observed dialogues to predict valid substituted reply perspectives. Experimental results show that CAPT outperforms baseline methods on multiple downstream tasks. The proposed method is evaluated on the Chinese Weibo corpus. The paper provides detailed descriptions of the data, implementation details, and evaluation metrics used.
