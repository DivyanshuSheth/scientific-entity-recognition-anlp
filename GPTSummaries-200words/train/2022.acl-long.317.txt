Summary:

The research paper presents a study on leveraging multilingual pre-trained generative language models for zero-shot cross-lingual event argument extraction (EAE). The proposed model, X-G (Cross-lingual Generative Event Argument extractor), effectively encodes event structures and captures dependencies between arguments. It uses language-agnostic templates to represent event argument structures, allowing for cross-lingual transfer. The model is trained on source languages and applied to target languages for event argument extraction. Experiments on ACE-2005 and ERE datasets demonstrate that X-G outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on zero-shot cross-lingual EAE. The evaluation metric used is the argument classification F1 score. The proposed model shows promise for zero-shot cross-lingual EAE without the need for additional modules or annotations.
