Summary : 
 
  The paper introduces a clustering - based loss correction framework named Feature Cluster Loss Correction ( FCLC ) for Fine - grained Entity Typing ( FET ) . FCLC first trains a coarse backbone model as a feature extractor and noise estimator . Loss correction is then applied to each feature cluster , learning directly from the noisy labels . Experimental results on three public datasets show that FCLC achieves the best performance compared to existing systems . The proposed model is stable to hyperparameters and helps mitigate confirmation bias . The model performs well even with no clean data . The evaluation metrics used are strict accuracy ( Acc ) , Macro F1 ( Ma - F1 ) , and Micro F1 ( Mi - F1 ) . The paper provides insights into the instance - dependent label noise problem in FET and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed FCLC framework . The dataset used is not explicitly mentioned in the paper .
