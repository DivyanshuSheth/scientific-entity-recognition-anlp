Summary : 
  The research paper explores language evolution , focusing on slang and its semantic change and frequency shift . The authors propose a causal framework to analyze the dynamics of slang words compared to standard language words . They use causal discovery and inference techniques to model the interactions between word type ( slang / nonslang ) , semantic change , and frequency shift . The analysis reveals that slang words undergo slower semantic change but show larger frequency shifts over time . The study confirms a direct causal effect of word type on semantic change and frequency shift . The findings also shed light on the relationship between word polysemy and frequency , supporting the S - curve theory . The study contributes to the understanding of language change dynamics and provides insights about the distinctive properties of slang words . The research is based on a curated Twitter dataset from 2010 and 2020 and employs causal analysis methods to uncover causal relationships in language evolution .
