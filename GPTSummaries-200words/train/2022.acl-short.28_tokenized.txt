This research paper focuses on document - level text simplification through sentence deletions . The authors propose incorporating a news genre - specific functional discourse structure to predict sentence deletions . They explore two methods of incorporating the structure : adding it as additional features or jointly predicting sentence deletions and discourse content types . Experimental results on the Newsela corpus show that both methods improve the recall and F1 - score of sentence deletion prediction . The paper includes a baseline model using a document - level neural network and two methods for incorporating the functional structure . The evaluation metrics used are recall and F1 - score . The paper is evaluated on predicting sentence deletions in news documents using the Newsela corpus . The baseline model outperforms a previous model proposed by Zhong et al . The dataset used for evaluation is the Newsela corpus , which contains 1492 English news articles and their simplified versions for different reading levels .
