Summary : 
  The research paper proposes a novel Graph Propagated Data Augmentation ( GPDA ) framework for Named Entity Recognition ( NER ) to improve model performance and robustness for low - resource NER . GPDA leverages graph propagation to build relationships between labeled and unlabeled natural texts . A search engine built on Wikipedia is utilized to fetch related texts and propagate entity labels . The paper conducts experiments on real - world low - resource datasets and shows that GPDA outperforms previous data augmentation methods on multiple low - resource NER datasets . The evaluation metric used is F1 score . The paper focuses on NER tasks and provides a publicly available low - resource NER dataset .
