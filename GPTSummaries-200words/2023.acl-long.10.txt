Summary:
In this research paper, the authors propose a method called "Subset kNN-MT" to improve the decoding speed of kNN-MT, a machine translation model that incorporates example-search into the decoding algorithm. Subset kNN-MT retrieves neighbor target tokens from a subset of neighbor sentences, rather than from all sentences, and uses an efficient distance computation technique using lookup tables. The authors evaluate Subset kNN-MT on the WMT'19 De-En translation task and domain adaptation tasks in De-En and En-Ja. They find that Subset kNN-MT achieves a significant speed-up of up to 132.2 times and an improvement in BLEU score of up to 1.6 compared to kNN-MT. The proposed method is evaluated using the LaBSE, AvgEnc, TF-IDF, and BM25 sentence encoders. The authors discuss the limitations of their work and ethical considerations related to the use of open datasets. Overall, Subset kNN-MT offers a faster and improved alternative to kNN-MT for machine translation tasks. (198 words)
