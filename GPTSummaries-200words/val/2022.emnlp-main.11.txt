Summary:

This research paper proposes a system for the automatic evaluation of counselor reflections in mental health counseling sessions. The system takes a dialog turn containing a client prompt and a counselor response, and outputs a numeric score indicating the quality of the reflection made by the counselor. The authors compile a dataset consisting of reflections with different levels of reflective listening skills and introduce a novel framework called Prompt-Aware margIn Ranking (PAIR) for reflection scoring. The system outperforms several baselines on different evaluation metrics and can provide useful feedback to counseling trainees in a real-life educational environment. The main contributions of this work include the formulation of the reflection scoring problem, the PAIR framework for reflection scoring, and quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the system on an annotated dataset and in an educational setting. This research is focused on the task of scoring counselor reflections and is evaluated on a dataset of counseling conversations.
