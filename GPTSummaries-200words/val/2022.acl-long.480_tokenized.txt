Summary : 
 
  This research paper focuses on the task of Simultaneous Machine Translation ( MT ) and proposes a state - of - the - art simultaneous sentence - level MT system extended to the streaming setup . The proposed system leverages the streaming history to achieve significant quality gains . The paper reports extensive empirical results on IWSLT Translation Tasks , showing that leveraging the streaming history leads to significant quality improvements compared to the baseline systems . The proposed system compares favorably to the best performing systems in terms of translation quality . The evaluation metrics used in this work include BLEU scores and latency measures such as Average Proportion ( AP ) , Average Lagging ( AL ) , and Differentiable Average Lagging ( DAL ) . The research is evaluated on the IWSLT Translation Task dataset .
