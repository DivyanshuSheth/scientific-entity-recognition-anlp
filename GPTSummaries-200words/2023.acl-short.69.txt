Summary:

This research paper proposes a deep active learning method for morphological processing tasks, specifically focusing on the morphological inflection and morphophonological processing of the Egyptian Arabic dialect. The proposed method aims to reduce the need for annotated data by selecting informative samples using an entropy strategy combined with a clustering method. The paper compares the proposed method to a baseline transformer model for character-level transduction tasks. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves similar results to the state-of-the-art model, using only about 30% of the annotated data. The paper also discusses previous work on morphological inflection processing and active learning methods in NLP. The proposed method is not language-specific and can be applied to other languages or dialects. The paper evaluates the method on the Arabic morphophonology dataset and provides experimental results on accuracy. Future research directions include applying the method to different low-resource Arabic dialects and exploring the effectiveness of the clustering method.
