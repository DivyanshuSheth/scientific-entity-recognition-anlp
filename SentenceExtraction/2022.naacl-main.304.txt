Abstract
Political perspective detection has become an
increasingly important task that can help com-
bat echo chambers and political polarization.
Previous approaches generally focus on lever-
aging textual content to identify stances, while
they fail to reason with background knowledge
or leverage the rich semantic and syntactic tex-
tual labels in news articles. In light of these
limitations, we propose KCD, a political per-
spective detection approach to enable multi-
hop knowledge reasoning and incorporate tex-
tual cues as paragraph-level labels. Specifi-
cally, we firstly generate random walks on ex-
ternal knowledge graphs and infuse them with
news text representations. We then construct a
heterogeneous information network to jointly
model news content as well as semantic, syn-
tactic and entity cues in news articles. Finally,
we adopt relational graph neural networks for
graph-level representation learning and conduct
political perspective detection. Extensive exper-
iments demonstrate that our approach outper-
forms state-of-the-art methods on two bench-
mark datasets. We further examine the effect of
knowledge walks and textual cues and how they
contribute to our approach’s data efficiency.
1 Introduction
Political perspective detection aims to identify ide-
ological stances of textual data such as social me-
dia posts and news articles. Previous approaches
generally leverage the textual content of news arti-
cles with various text modeling techniques to iden-
tify political stances. Those works (Jiang et al.,
2019; Li and Goldwasser, 2019, 2021; Feng et al.,
2021a) leveraged diversified text models, such as
recurrent neural networks (Yang et al., 2016), word
embedding techniques (Pennington et al., 2014; Pe-
ters et al., 2018), convolutional neural networks
(Jiang et al., 2019), and pre-trained language mod-
els (Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019), to encodeFigure 1: Multi-hop knowledge reasoning and implicit
textual indicators that facilitate perspective detection.
news paragraphs and classify them into different
perspective labels. Later approaches incorporate
information sources beyond text to facilitate argu-
ment mining and boost task performance. News
discussion on social networks (Li and Goldwasser,
2019), social and linguistic information about news
articles (Li and Goldwasser, 2021), media sources
and information (Baly et al., 2020) as well as exter-
nal knowledge from knowledge graphs (Feng et al.,
2021a) are introduced in the task of political per-
spective detection and achieve better performance.
Although these methods attempted to leverage
more than news content, they fail to present a frame-
work capable of reasoning with background knowl-
edge and leveraging implicit semantic and syntactic
indicators such as sentiment and tense of news arti-
cles. For example, Figure 1 presents a typical news4129article from Daily Kos. This article discusses re-
marks from the Trump campaign team about Wik-
ileaks and its effect on Hillary Clinton’s bid for
president. Individuals often rely on the multi-hop
reasoning that Clinton and Trump are from oppo-
site political parties and run against each other to
inform their perspective analysis process. Besides,
the negative sentiment expressed in satiric tones
and the quotation of Trump campaign staff also
give away the author’s denial and left-leaning per-
spective. That being said, knowledge reasoning
and implicit textual indicators are essential in the
news bias detection process.
In light of these limitations, we propose a
political perspective detection framework KCD
(Knowledge Walks and Textual Cues Enhanced
Political Perspective Detection). Specifically, KCD
generates multi-hop knowledge walks, aggregates
them based on semantic relevance and incorporates
them in textual representations with multi-head
attention. KCD then constructs a heterogeneous
information network to jointly model knowledge-
enriched news content and diversified textual cues
as paragraph-level labels. Finally, KCD learns
graph representations with relational graph neural
networks and conduct perspective detection with
different aggregation strategies. Our main contri-
butions are summarized as follows:
•We propose knowledge walks, a strategy to in-
corporate multi-hop knowledge reasoning in tex-
tual representations for knowledge-aware politi-
cal perspective detection.
•We propose to construct a heterogeneous infor-
mation network to represent news articles, which
jointly models knowledge-enriched news content
and implicit textual cues in news articles.
•Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ap-
proach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on two widely adopted benchmarks.
Further analysis bears out the necessity of knowl-
edge walks and textual cues in our approach.
2 Related Work
2.1 Political Perspective Detection
Political perspective detection aims to identify
the ideological stances of news articles, which is
widely studied to help strengthen the online infor-
mation landscape (Li and Goldwasser, 2019) andmitigate ideological echo chambers (Li and Gold-
wasser, 2021; Feng et al., 2021a). Early approaches
leverage text analysis techniques for bias detection,
such as sentiment analysis (Jiang et al., 2011; Wang
et al., 2017), bias feature extraction (Horne et al.,
2018), word embeddings (Jiang et al., 2019; Li and
Goldwasser, 2019), and different neural network ar-
chitectures (Augenstein et al., 2016; Du et al., 2017;
Xu et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2019;
Feng et al., 2021b; Li and Goldwasser, 2021; Feng
et al., 2021a). In addition to textual content of news
articles, social media users also become the focus
of perspective detection research (Bel-Enguix et al.,
2021). User interactions (Magdy et al., 2016), user
clustering (Darwish et al., 2020), and label propa-
gation (Stefanov et al., 2020) are leveraged to iden-
tify the ideological preferences on social media.
Fusing both news text and social network analy-
sis directions, Li and Goldwasser (2019) propose
to enrich news text with the content and structure
of social media discussions about these news arti-
cles. Recent state-of-the-art approaches chart a new
path by incorporating social and political external
knowledge into stance detection. Baly et al. (2020)
propose adversarial media adaptation and leverage
source background knowledge for political perspec-
tive detection. Li and Goldwasser (2021) combine
language encoders with pre-training tasks of social
and linguistic information. Feng et al. (2021a) pro-
pose to construct and leverage political knowledge
graphs as domain-specific external knowledge. In
this paper, we build on these works to examine
and explore the effect of multi-hop knowledge rea-
soning and diversified textual cues in the task of
political perspective detection.
2.2 Knowledge Graph in NLP
Knowledge graphs (KGs) are effective representa-
tions of real-world entities, relations, and knowl-
edge. Generic (Fellbaum, 2010; Pellissier Tanon
et al., 2020; Bollacker et al., 2008; Speer et al.,
2017) and domain-specific KGs (Feng et al., 2021a;
Chang et al., 2020) are widely adopted in NLP tasks
as external knowledge sources. These approaches
could mainly be categorized into feature extraction,
language model and graph-based methods. For
feature extraction approaches, KG embedding tech-
nique TransE (Bordes et al., 2013) is leveraged to
learn features for knowledge injecton (Ostendorff
et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2021). For language model
approaches, the adapter architecture is leveraged4130
to fine-tune on KG-related tasks (Majewska et al.,
2021; Meng et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2021). In ad-
dition, Wang et al. (2021) propose a unified model
to combine knowledge embedding with language
representation pre-training. For graph-based ap-
proaches, KG entities and relations are injected into
graphs and heterogeneous information networks
(Hu et al., 2021; Feng et al., 2021a; Lu et al., 2021).
Graph neural networks are then adopted to learn
knowledge-aware text representations. In this pa-
per, we propose knowledge walk, a novel strategy
to infuse multi-hop knowledge reasoning into lan-
guage representations and apply them in political
perspective detection.
3 Methodology
Figure 2 presents an overview of our proposed
political perspective detection framework KCD
(Knowledge Walks and Textual Cues Enhanced Po-
litical Perspective Detection). We firstly generate
knowledge walks on the external knowledge graph.
These knowledge walks are then selected based on
semantic relevance and injected into textual rep-
resentations with multi-head attention. We then
construct a heterogeneous information network to
jointly model knowledge-enriched news content
and diversified textual cues as paragraph-level la-
bels and supernodes. Finally, we adopt relational
graph neural networks and different aggregation
strategies to learn graph-level representation and
conduct political perspective detection.
3.1 Knowledge Walks and Infusion
We firstly propose the novel strategy of knowl-
edge walks and combine them with textual rep-resentations to enable multi-hop knowledge rea-
soning. We partition an n-paragraph news docu-
ment into different paragraphs and denote them
asS={s, ..., s}. We encode each paragraph
by averaging the the embeddings of words from
pre-trained RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019):
v=RoBERTa (s),1≤i≤n (1)
We use a political knowledge graphas external
knowledge for perspective detection. Let the i-
th triple in the knowledge graph be (e, r, e),
where eandedenote the head and tail entity
andrrepresents the relation of the i-th triple.
3.1.1 Knowledge Walk Generation
We firstly use TagMe (Ferragina and Scaiella, 2012)
to identify mentioned KG entities in each paragraph
s. For each mentioned entity, we use it as the
starting point ein aK-hop knowledge walk:
kw={e, r, e, ..., r, e}(2)
where eandrdenote the i-th triple’s head
entity and relation. Specifically, a knowledge walk
is generated by adopting biased random walk of
length Kstarting from e. The conditional prob-
ability of arriving at efromethrough r
is formulated as
P(e|e, r) =exp(p(r))
/summationtext exp(p(r))
(3)4131where N(i−1)denotes the neighboring relations
ofe,p(r)is the importance score of KG rela-
tionr, which could be tuned by domain experts for
human-in-the-loop knowledge walk generation. In
this way, we generate multiple knowledge walks
for each paragraph based on its mentioned entities,
which models the multi-hop reasoning process with
external knowledge.
3.1.2 Semantic-Guided Selection
After obtaining multiple knowledge walks for a
single news paragraph, we propose a selection and
aggregation process guided by textual content to
differentiate essential knowledge walks from the
irrelevant ones. We firstly transform each knowl-
edge walk kwinto a sentence tby concatenating
the textual description of entities and relations. We
then encode the knowledge walk sentence twith
pre-trained RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019):
v=RoBERTa (t) (4)
Suppose a total of mknowledge walks
{kw}are generated for paragraph s, we then
aggregate their knowledge walk sentence embed-
dings{v}as follows:
v=/summationdisplayexp(α·v)
/summationtextexp(α·v)v (5)
where αdenotes the learnable attention vector
guided by paragraph semantics:
α=ϕ(Wv+b) (6)
where Wandbare learnable parameters of the
attention module and we use Leaky-ReLU for ϕ.
vis the sentence embedding from equation 1. In
this way, we aggregate mknowledge walks based
on semantic relevance to the paragraph to filter and
retain important knowledge reasoning paths.
3.1.3 Knowledge Infusion
After representing multi-hop knowledge reasoning
for paragraph swithv, we conduct document-
wise multi-head self-attention to infuse knowledge
walks into textual representations v. We concate-
nate knowledge walk and text representations:
T=concat ([v, v, ..., v, v]) (7)
where Tis the input for multi-head self-attention:
˜T=MultiHead (Q, K, V ) (8)where Q=K=V=Tand the output ˜T=
concat ([˜v,˜v, ...,˜v,˜v]). In this way, we ob-
tain language representations of news paragraphs
{˜v}, which jointly models textual content and
related multi-hop knowledge reasoning paths.
3.2 Textual Cues and Graph Construction
We construct a heterogeneous information network
(HIN) as in Figure 2 “Graph Construction“ to
jointly represent knowledge-enriched news con-
tent and diversified textual cues in news articles.
Specifically, we use paragraph nodes to represent
the news content and connect them with different
paragraph-level labels with heterogeneous edges.
Firstly, for paragraph nodes:
V1andR1: Paragraph Nodes We use one node in
V1to represent each paragraph in the news ar-
ticle to partition the entire document and allow
fine-grained analysis. We adopt the knowledge-
enriched representations {˜v}in Section 3.1 as
initial node features for V1. We then use relation
R1to connect adjacent paragraphs to preserve the
original flow of the news article.
3.2.1 Semantic Cues
We further analyze the topic and sentiment of news
paragraphs, extract paragraph-level labels and in-
ject them into our news HIN structure.
V2andR2: Topic Cues The topics and frequent
topic switching in news articles often give away
the stance and argument of authors. We train LDA
to extract the topics in each political perspective
detection corpus and use one node to represent
each topic. We then encode the topic text with pre-
trained RoBERTa as node attributes. We then use
R2to connect each paragraph node in V1with its
affiliated topic node in V2with the help of Bert-
Topic (Grootendorst, 2020).
V3andR3: Sentiment Cues The sentiment of
news articles signal the authors’ approval or de-
nial, which helps identify their stances towards
individuals and issues. We use two nodes to repre-
sent positive and negative sentiment and we make
their node attributes learnable. We then conduct
sentiment analysis (Wolf et al., 2020) to identify
paragraph sentiment and use R3to connect V1
with their corresponding sentiment nodes in V3.
3.2.2 Syntactic Cues
Apart from semantic cues, syntactic information
in news articles also contribute to the perspective
analysis process (Dutta et al., 2022). In light of4132this, we analyze the tense of news paragraphs and
whether it contains direct quotation and use them
as paragraph-level labels in our constructed HIN.
V4andR4: Tense Cues The tense of news para-
graphs helps separate facts from opinions. For
example, simple past tense often indicates factual
statements while simple future tense suggests opin-
ions and projections that might not be factual. We
use 17 nodes in V4to represent 17 possible tenses
in our constructed news HIN. We use NLTK (Bird
et al., 2009) to extract paragraph tenses and use R4
to connect paragraph nodes in V1withV4.
V5andR5: Quotation Cues It is common for au-
thors to directly quote others’ words in news ar-
ticles, which helps to identify the basis of the au-
thor’s argument. We use two nodes to differentiate
between whether a news paragraph quotes someone
or not. Specifically, we identify quotation marks in
news paragraphs and use R6to connect V1with
V6based on whether direct quotation is detected.
3.2.3 Entity Cues
V6andR6: Entity Cues We follow previous
works (Feng et al., 2021a; Hu et al., 2021) to use
one node to represent each entity in the external
knowledge graph. We adopt TransE (Bordes et al.,
2013) to learn knowledge graph embeddings and
use them as initial node features for V6. We then
adopt entity linking tool TagMe (Ferragina and
Scaiella, 2012) to align news paragraphs with their
mentioned entities and use R6to connect V1with
V6correspondingly.
In this way, we obtain a heterogeneous infor-
mation network for news articles that jointly mod-
els knowledge-enriched news content and diversi-
fied textual cues in news articles. Our approach
could be similarly extended to other textual cues
and paragraph-level labels that would be helpful in
political perspective detection and related tasks.
3.3 Learning and Optimization
Upon obtaining the news HINs, we adopt rela-
tional graph neural networks for representation
learning and conduct political perspective detec-
tion as graph-level classification. Specifically, we
follow Feng et al. (2021a) and use gated R-GCN to
ensure a fair comparison and highlight the effective-
ness of knowledge walks and textual cues. After
Llayers of gated R-GCN, we denote the learned
node representations as vand obtain graph-level

4 Experiments
4.1 Dataset
We make use of two real-world political perspective
detection datasets SemEval (Kiesel et al., 2019)
and Allsides (Li and Goldwasser, 2019), which are
widely adopted in various previous works (Li and
Goldwasser, 2019, 2021; Feng et al., 2021a). We
follow the same evaluation settings as in previous
works so that our results are directly comparable.
Section B in the appendix provides more dataset
details to facilitate reproduction.41334.2 Baselines
We compare KCD with the following competitive
baselines and state-of-the-art methods:
•CNN (Jiang et al., 2019) is the first-place solu-
tion in the SemEval 2019 Task 4 contest (Kiesel
et al., 2019). It combines convolutional neural
networks with Glove (Jiang et al., 2019) and
ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) for political perspec-
tive detection on the SemEval dataset.
•HLSTM (Yang et al., 2016) is short for hierar-
chical long short-term memory networks. Li and
Goldwasser (2019) uses HLSTMs and different
word embeddings for news bias detection.
•HLSTM_Embed andHLSTM_Output (Li and
Goldwasser, 2021) leverage entity information
with masked entity models in addition to news
content for political perspective detection.
•Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013), GloVe (Pen-
nington et al., 2014), ELMo (Peters et al., 2018),
pre-trained BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and
RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) are leveraged by
Feng et al. (2021a) as textual features and po-
litical perspective detection is further conducted
with two fully connected layers.
•MAN (Li and Goldwasser, 2021) incorporates so-
cial and linguistic information with pre-training
tasks and conducts fine-tuning on the task of po-
litical perspective detection.
•KGAP (Feng et al., 2021a), short for Knowledge
Graph Augmented Political perspective detec-
tion, leverages knowledge graphs and graph neu-
ral networks for a knowledge-aware approach.
We compare our gated R-GCN based approach
with KGAP’s gated R-GCN setting.
4.3 Implementation
We implement our KCD framework with pytorch
(Paszke et al., 2019), pytorch lightning (Falcon
and The PyTorch Lightning team, 2019), pytorch
geometric (Fey and Lenssen, 2019), and the trans-
formers library (Wolf et al., 2020). We present our
hyperparameter settings in Table 1 to facilitate re-
production. We adhere to these settings throughout
all experiments in the paper unless stated otherwise.
Our implementation is trained on a Titan X GPU
with 12GB memory. We make our code and data
publicly available.
4.4 Experiment Results
We present model performance on two benchmark
datasets in Table 2, which demonstrates that
•KCD, especially with the PA aggregation strat-
egy, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both benchmark datasets.
•KGAP and KCD, which incorporate knowledge
graphs, outperform other baselines. This indi-
cates that external knowledge is essential in pro-
viding background information and political con-
text to analyze ideological perspectives. KCD
without textual cues performs better than base-
line methods except KGAP and performs close
to KGAP. These suggests that KGAP’s method
of infusing knowledge as HIN nodes and our
method of infusing knowledge as knowledge
walks are both effective.
•PA outperforms CA and GA on both datasets,
which suggests that the aggregation strategy is
important since subsidiary nodes like textual cues
may result in noise. As a result, we should focus
on paragraph nodes in our heterogeneous infor-
mation networks.4134
•Removing textual cues and knowledge walks
in KCD result in substantial performance drop,
which demonstrates the effectiveness of textual
cues and knowledge walks.
In the following, we examine the effect of knowl-
edge walks and textual cues in our approach. We
also explore how our approach performs with lim-
ited data compared to baseline methods.
4.5 Knowledge Walks Study
We propose knowledge walks, an approach to con-
duct multi-hop reasoning on knowledge graphs and
inject them into textual representations. We study
the effect of knowledge walk length and knowledge
infusion strategies on our model’s performance.
4.5.1 Knowledge Walks Length
Our proposed knowledge walks could be of any
length, where shorter walks provide more con-
densed knowledge and longer walks provide more
diverse knowledge. To examine the effect of knowl-
edge walk length, we generate 5,088knowledge
walks of 1 to 10 triples and present model per-
formance in Figure 3. It is illustrated that longer
knowledge walks (8 or 9 for SemEval, 7 or 8 for
Allsides) perform better than shorter ones, indicat-
ing the necessity of multi-hop knowledge reasoning
in the task of political perspective detection.
4.5.2 Knowledge Infusion Strategy
We propose a two-step approach to infuse multi-
hop knowledge reasoning into textual representa-
tions of news articles:
•First Aggregation: We firstly aggregate different
generated knowledge walks based on semantic
relevance in Equ. (5) and Equ. (6).
•Second Aggregation: We then use multi-head
attention to aggregate all paragraphs and knowl-
edge representations with Equ. (7) and Equ. (8).
To examine the effect of our knowledge infusion
strategy, we substitute these two aggregation steps
with different multi-head attention settings as well
as max and average pooling. Results in Figure 4
demonstrate significant performance difference on
the horizontal axis. This suggests that our seman-
tic relevance-based knowledge walks aggregation
strategy in Equ. (5) and Equ. (6) successfully filters
out irrelevant knowledge reasoning and contributes
to model performance. Besides, according to the
vertical axis, our adopted multi-head attention in
Equ. (7) and Equ. (8) is generally effective and
does not rely on specific attention head settings.
4.6 Textual Cues Study
We propose to leverage semantic, syntactic and en-
tity textual cues as paragraph-level labels to lever-
age implicit indicators in news articles for political
perspective detection. To examine the effectiveness
of these textual cues, we randomly remove them
with probability pand present model performance
in Figure 5. It is illustrated that:4135
•A performance boost is observed between 0%
and100% for all five textual cues, suggesting the
necessity of modeling implicit textual indicators.
Besides, adding only part of textual cues some-
times leads to a decrease in performance, which
implies that incomplete cues may be counter-
productive and introduce noise.
•Among five different cues, entity and quotation
cues contribute more to model performance than
others. This suggests some implicit textual cues
are more important than others in analyzing the
ideological perspectives of news articles.
•The effect of textual cues is larger on the dataset
SemEval, which is significantly smaller than All-
sides. This suggests that we alleviate the data-
hungry problem by introducing diversified tex-
tual cues as paragraph-level labels and contribute
to model performance.
4.7 Data Efficiency Study
As Li and Goldwasser (2021) point out, supervised
data annotations could be difficult and expensive to
obtain for the task of political perspective detection
in news media. Our proposed knowledge walks
and textual cues serve as additional information
and might help mitigate this issue. To examine
whether we have achieved this end, we train KCD,
KGAP (Feng et al., 2021a) as well as various text
models with reduced training sets of SemEval and
Allsides. Results in Figure 6 demonstrate that
•KCD has better data efficiency and achieves
steady performance with smaller training sets.
This observation is especially salient on Allsides
where the news articles are longer (Li and Gold-
wasser, 2021), thus more knowledge walks and
textual cues could be extracted and incorporated
to alleviate data dependence.
•Both KCD and KGAP leverage external knowl-
edge and are more robust to reduced datasets.
Our approach further leverages textual cues and
has better data deficiency. This suggests that a
solution to limited data could be incorporating
information in addition to news content.
•With only 10% training set, KCD outperforms
all baselines by at least 5.68% and 9.71% in ac-
curacy on two datasets. This suggests that our ap-
proach is simple, effective, and not data-hungry
under limited data settings.
5 Conclusion
In this paper,we propose KCD, a political perspec-
tive detection approach that reasons with multi-hop
external knowledge and leverages diversified im-
plicit textual indicators. We firstly generate multi-
hop knowledge walks, dynamically aggregate them4136based on semantic relevance and infuse into news
text representations. We then construct a het-
erogeneous information network to jointly model
knowledge-enriched news content and diversified
textual cues as paragraph-level labels. Finally, we
learn graph representations with relational graph
neural networks under different aggregation set-
tings and conduct political perspective detection as
graph-level classification. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach consistently outper-
forms state-of-the-art baselines on two benchmark
datasets. Further experiments also bear out the
necessity of knowledge walks and textual cues in
modeling political perspectives in news media.

A Limitations
Our proposed model has two minor limitations:
•We propose to model news articles with hetero-
geneous information networks. This graph-based
approach might not fit well with shorter news arti-
cles with only a few paragraphs. This issue might
be addressed by using sentence nodes instead of
paragraph nodes for shorter articles.
•For very large knowledge graphs with many dif-
ferent types of relations, it might be hard for do-
main experts to help set p(r)for every knowledge
graph relation. This issue might be addressed by
only setting a larger p(r)for several important
rs according to domain expert.4139
B Dataset Details
We used the same datasets as in previous works (Li
and Goldwasser, 2019, 2021; Feng et al., 2021a),
namely SemEval (Kiesel et al., 2019) and Allsides
(Li and Goldwasser, 2019). We follow the same
10-fold setting for SemEval and 3-fold setting for
Allsides (Li and Goldwasser, 2021). We use the
exact same folds so that the results are directly com-
parable. A minor difference would be that we have
to discard a few news articles on Allsides since
their urls have expired and we could not retrieve
their original news article. We report the statistical
information of SemEval and Allsides in Table 3.
C Computation Details
C.1 Computational Resources
Our proposed approach has a total of 7.8M learn-
able parameters. It takes approximately 0.7 and 1.6
GPU hours to train our approach on two datasets
respectively. We train our model on one Titan X
GPU with 12GB memory.
C.2 Experiment Runs
We run our approach with three different aggrega-
tion strategies five times and report the average
accuracy and macro F1-score with standard devi-
ation in Table 4. For experiments in Section 4.5,
4.6 and 4.7, we do not have enough computational
resources to run five times, thus we report the per-
formance of a single run.D Scientific Artifact Usage
We provide additional details about used scientific
artifacts and specifically how we used them.
•NLTK (Bird et al., 2009): We use NLTK to ex-
tract the tense of news articles. Specifically, we
first use NLTK POS-tagger to process new para-
graphs and attach speech tag to each word. Then
we align verb tags with NLTK tagset to identify
the tense of paragraphs.
•BertTopic (Grootendorst, 2020): We use Bert-
Topic to mine the topics of news corpus. Specif-
ically, we use BertTopic topic model to learn
dataset-specific topic models. For SemEval we
obtained 197 topics and for Allsides we obtained
1225 topics. Next, we predict topics for each
news paragraph. Each topic consists of ten topic
words with scores and we select the top five to
serve as the news paragraph’s topic.
•Huggingface Transformers (Wolf et al., 2020):
We use the pipeline module for sentiment analy-
sis. Specifically, we use the sentiment analysis
API in the text classification pipeline to generate
a sentiment label and score for news paragraphs.
We then use the sentiment label as the sentiment
cues for news paragraphs.
•TagMe (Ferragina and Scaiella, 2012): We use
TagMe to align news articles with entities in the
knowledge graph. Specifically, we use TagMe to
annotate named entities in news paragraphs and
save the entities with a score higher than 0.1 for
further alignment. We then calculate the similar-
ity score between TagMe annotated entities and
political knowledge graph entities. We recognize
the entities with a score higher than 0.9 as entity
cues in our constructed HIN.
•Political knowledge graph (Feng et al., 2021a):
We use the political knowledge graph collected
in Feng et al. (2021a) for external knowledge in
political perspective detection.
•OpenKE (Han et al., 2018): We use OpenKE
to train TransE (Bordes et al., 2013) knowledge
graph embeddings for the political knowledge
graph. Specifically, we set the TransE hidden
size to 768 and train the model with other default
hyperparameters in OpenKE.4140
