Though the BERT - like pretrained language models have achieved great success , using their sentence representations directly often results in poor performance on the semantic textual similarity task . Recently , several contrastive learning methods have been proposed for learning sentence representations and have shown promising results . However , most of them focus on the constitution of positive and negative representation pairs and pay little attention to the training objective like NT - Xent , which is not sufficient enough to acquire the discriminating power and is unable to model the partial order of semantics between sentences . So in this paper , we propose a new method ArcCSE , with training objectives designed to enhance the pairwise discriminative power and model the entailment relation of triplet sentences . We conduct extensive experiments which demonstrate that our approach outperforms the previous state - of - the - art on diverse sentence related tasks , including STS and SentEval . Figure 1 : Sentence representations visualization . We generate the representations of three related sentences by passing them to BERTbase , SimCSE - BERTbase and ArcCSE - BERTbase multiple times . With different dropout masks , we can generate different representations for each sentence . Then we normalize the embeddings and use t - SNE for dimensionality reduction . or applying mean pooling on the last layers of a BERT - like pre - trained language model ( Reimers and Gurevych , 2019 ) . However , the sentence embeddings coming from a pre - trained language model without further fine - tuning could not capture the semantic meaning of sentences very well as shown in Figure 1(a ) , and sometimes even underperform non - contextualized embeddings like GloVe ( Pennington et al . , 2014 ) . 1 Introduction Learning sentence representations , which encodes sentences into fixed - sized dense vectors such that semantically similar ones stay close , is a fundamental problem of natural language processing . It could benefit a wide range of downstream applications such as information retrieval , semantic similarity comparison , question answering , and so on . Recently , with the great success of pre - trained Transformer - based language models ( Devlin et al . , 2019 ; Liu et al . , 2019 ; Raffel et al . , 2020 ; Brown et al . , 2020 ; Liu et al . , 2019 ) like BERT , they have been widely adopted for generating sentence representations . A straightforward way is by leveraging the [ CLS ] embedding ( Devlin et al . , 2019 ) To make pre - trained language models more suitable for generating sentence embeddings , supervised methods like SBERT ( Reimers and Gurevych , 2019 ) are proposed , which improve the performance by fine - tuning on a labeled dataset . As labeled data is not available or expensive to annotate in many tasks or domains , it is of great value for developing unsupervised / self - supervised approaches for learning sentence representations . So recent works like BERT - Flow ( Li et al . , 2020 ) and BERT - Whitening ( Su et al . , 2021 ) propose postprocessing methods to improve the BERT - based sentence representation . They address that the nonsmooth anisotropic semantic space of BERT is a bottleneck and alleviate the problem through normalizing flows and whitening operation . To further improve the quality of sentence representations , several works ( Kim et al . , 2021 ; Yan et al . , 2021 ; Giorgi et al . , 2021 ; Carlsson et al . , 2021 ; Gao et al . , 2021 ) adopt self - supervised contrastive learning approach , which learns sentence representations by minimizing the distance of positive sentence representation pairs and maximizing the distance of negative pairs . In these works , positive pairs are often constituted through data augmentation or encoders with different structure or parameters , while negative pairs are derived from different sentences within the same batch . Then contrastive learning objective like normalized temperature - scaled crossentropy loss ( NT - Xent ) ( Chen et al . , 2020 ; Gao et al . , 2021 ) is used for optimizing . A typical example unsup - SimCSE ( Gao et al . , 2021 ) achieves state - of - the - art performance with a simple and effective idea of using standard dropout for data augmentation . between sentences . To alleviate these problems , in this paper , we propose a new approach ArcCSE for sentence representation learning . For pairwise sentence relation modeling , we propose Additive Angular Margin Contrastive Loss ( ArcCon Loss ) , which enhances the pairwise discriminative power by maximizing the decision margin in the angular space . Besides , in order to model the partial order of semantics between sentences , we propose a new self - supervised task that captures the entailment relation among triplet sentences . The task is implemented through automatically constituted triplet sentences with entailment relation among them . A visualization example of the generated representations through ArcCSE is shown in Figure 1(c ) . We evaluate our method on standard semantic textual similarity ( STS ) tasks and SentEval transfer tasks , and it outperforms the previous state - of - the - art approaches . 2 Related Work 2.1 Unsupervised Sentence Representation Learning Early works usually learn sentence representations by augmenting the idea of word2vec ( Mikolov et al . , 2013 ) , such as predicting surrounding sentences ( Kiros et al . , 2015 ; Hill et al . , 2016 ; Logeswaran and Lee , 2018 ) or summing up n - gram embeddings ( Pagliardini et al . , 2018 ) . With the rise of pre - trained language models , many works try to generate sentence representations through BERT - like models . A common way is leveraging the [ CLS ] embedding or applying mean pooling on the last layers of BERT ( Reimers and Gurevych , 2019 ; Li et al . , 2020 ) . Instead of using BERT embeddings directly , BERT - Flow ( Li et al . , 2020 ) and BERT - Whitening ( Su et al . , 2021 ) further improve sentence representation through post - processing . Though existing contrastive methods for learning sentence representation have shown promising results , most of them focus on the positive and negative pairs constitution , and the optimization objective itself is not fully exploited . The contrastive learning objective NT - Xent loss used in recent works ( Yan et al . , 2021 ; Giorgi et al . , 2021 ; Gao et al . , 2021 ) is a variation of cross - entropy loss with softmax function . Recent studies ( Wang et al . , 2018 ; Deng et al . , 2019 ) have shown that the traditional softmax - based loss is insufficient to acquire the discriminating power , as shown in Figure 1(b ) in which SimCSE - BERTbase adopts the NT - Xent loss and could not separate sb and sc completely . In addition , the current optimization objectives only models sentence relations in a pairwise perspective , which tries to pull sentences with similar semantics closer and push dissimilar ones away from each other . However , there are different degrees of semantic similarity among related sentences . For example in Figure 1(d ) , sb is more similar to sa than sc is . The current optimization objectives lack the ability to model the partial order of semantics Recently , several works adopt the contrastive learning framework for sentence representation learning . They propose different strategies to constitute contrastive pairs , either through different data transforming methods ( Zhang et al . , 2020 ; Yan et al . , 2021 ; Giorgi et al . , 2021 ) , or through encoders with different structures or parameters ( Carlsson et al . , 2021 ; Kim et al . , 2021 ; Gao et al . , 2021 ) . A typical example SimCSE ( Gao et al . , 2021 ) uses dropout as data augmentation strategy and achieves state - of - the - art performance . However , most existing works pay little attention to the training objective and use the traditional contrastive Figure 2 : The framework of ArcCSE . ArcCSE models pairwise and triple - wise sentence relations simultaneously . For pairwise sentence relation modeling , we pass sentences to a BERT - like encoder with dropout turn on twice . Then we feed the representations into ArcCon loss which is more discriminative than NT - Xent loss . Triplet sentences are constituted through masking . We pass them to the same BERT - like encoder with dropout turn off and use a triplet loss to model their relations . loss directly , which is insufficient in discrimination and unable to model the partial order of semantics between sentences . So , in our work , we propose a new approach that jointly models the pairwise and triple - wise sentence relations and further improves the sentence representations ’ quality . ing results in supervised metric learning . Typical examples like Center Loss ( Wen et al . , 2016 ) , SphereFace ( Liu et al . , 2017 ) , CosFace ( Wang et al . , 2018 ) and ArcFace ( Deng et al . , 2019 ) are widely adopted in deep learning applications such as face recognition and sentence classification ( Coria et al . , 2020 ) . However , these losses need class labels and are not suitable for learning sentence representations . So inspired by ArcFace , we propose a new training objective ArcCon that does not need class labels and can model pairwise sentence relations with more discriminative power than traditional contrastive training objectives . 2.2 Deep Metric Learning Objectives The goal of Deep Metric Learning ( DML ) is to learn a function that maps objects into an embedded space , in which similar objects stay close and dissimilar ones are far away . In order to achieve this goal , many approaches have been proposed , and designing appropriate loss functions plays a key role in it . Contrastive training objectives like Contrastive Loss ( Chopra et al . , 2005 ) , N - Pair Loss ( Sohn , 2016 ) , Structured Loss ( Song et al . , 2016 ) and Triplet Margin Loss ( Ma et al . , 2021 ) apply the definition of metric learning directly . These objectives are among the earliest training objectives used for deep metric learning . Later , softmax - based losses which learn a center for each class and penalize the distances between deep features and their corresponding class centers achieve more promis3 Method In this section , we present ArcCSE , an angular based contrastive sentence representation learning framework , which could generate superior sentence embeddings from unlabeled data . Given a pretrained language model M and an unlabeled text dataset D , the task is fine - tuning M on D so that the sentence representations generated through M could be more semantic discriminative . Our framework consists of two components that model pairwise and triple - wise sentence relations simultaneously , as shown in Figure 2 . We start with angular margin based contrastive learning in Section 3.1 , which models pairwise relations between sentences by pulling semantic similar ones closer while pushing dissimilar ones away . Then we introduce the method which models the partial order of semantics between automatically constituted triplet sentences in Section 3.2 . Figure 3 : Comparison of NT - Xent loss and ArcCon loss . For sentence representation hi , we try to make θi , i∗ smaller and θi , j larger , so the optimization direction follows the arrow . With an extra margin m , ArcCon is more discriminative and noise - tolerant . 3.1 Angular Margin based Contrastive Learning To model the positive / negative pairwise relations between sentences , we first need to generate sentence representations and group them into positive and negative pairs . Then we feed these pairs to a training objective for optimizing . The decision boundary for hi in NT - Xent is θi , i∗ = θi , j , as show in Figure 3 . Due to lack of decision margin , a small perturbation around the decision boundary may lead to an incorrect decision . Given a collection of sentences D = { si}N i=1 , we generate the sentence representations through a BERT - like pre - trained language model M. Following SimCSE , we use dropout as the data augmentation method . For each sentence si , we generate two different representations hi and h∗i from si by passing si to M twice with independently sampled dropout masks . These two representations with the same semantics constitute a positive pair , while the negative pairs are derived from the representations of different sentences within the same batch . To overcome the problem , we propose a new training objective for sentence representation learning by adding an additive angular margin m between positive pair hi and h∗i . We named it Additive Angular Margin Contrastive Loss ( ArcCon Loss ) , which can be formulated as follows : ecos(θi , i∗ + m)/τ Larc = −log ecos(θi , i∗ + m)/τ + ( cid:80 ) j = i ecos(θj , i)/τ ( 3 ) In this loss , the decision boundary for hi is θi , i∗ + m = θi , j , as show in Figure 3 . Compared with NT - Xent , it further pushed hi towards to the area where θi , i∗ get smaller and θi , j get larger , by increasing the compactness of sentence representations with the same semantics and enlarging the discrepancy of different semantic representations . This help enhance the alignment and uniformity properties ( Wang and Isola , 2020 ) , which are two key measures of representation quality related to contrastive learning , indicating how close between positive pair embeddings and how well the embeddings are uniformly distributed . The quantitative analysis is illustrated in Section 4.5 . Besides , the decision boundary leaves an extra margin m to boundary θi , i∗ = θi , j which is often used during inference , making it more tolerant to noise and more robust . All these properties make ArcCon loss more discriminative than traditional training objectives like NT - Xent . Compared with Arcface ( Deng et al . , 2019 ) which is often used in largescale fine - grained categorization in computer vision community , ArcCon loss does not need clas̸ After getting the positive and negative sentence pairs , we put them into a training objective for model fine - tune . The most widely adopted training objective is NT - Xent loss ( Chen et al . , 2020 ; Gao et al . , 2021 ) , which has been used in previous sentence and image representation learning methods and can be formulated as follows : esim(hi , h∗ j=1 esim(hi , hj ) /τ i ) /τ LNT - Xent = −log ( 1 ) ( cid:80)n where sim ( hi , hj ) is the cosine similarity hT i hj , τ is a temperature hyperparameter and hi hj ||∗|| || n is the number of sentences within a batch . || Though the training objective tries to pull representations with similar semantics closer and push dissimilar ones away from each other , these representations may still not be sufficiently discriminative and not very robust to noise . Let us denote angular θi , j as follows : ( cid:18 ) ( cid:19 ) hT i hj ||hi|| ∗ ||hj|| θi , j = arccos ( 2 ) As s′i is more similar to si in semantics than s′′i is , we could model such relation with a triplet objective : Ltri = max ( cid:0)0 , sim(¯hi , ¯h′′i ) − sim(¯hi , ¯h′i ) + m(cid:1 ) ( 4 ) in which ¯hi is the sentence representation of si generated without dropout noise and sim(i , j ) is the cosine similarity between i and j. As the semantic difference between s′i and s′′i may be subtle depending on the original sentence si and the masked words , here we set m to zero . sification labels , and could handle contrastive task properly . 3.2 Modeling Entailment Relation of Triplet Sentences Previously the training objectives for sentence representation learning like NT - Xent loss only considered pairwise sentence relations , in which sentences are either similar or dissimilar in semantics . But in fact , there are varying degrees of semantic similarity . For example , sentence s2 could be more similar to sentence s1 than sentence s3 to s1 . Existing methods lack the ability to model such partial order of semantics between sentences . Combine formula ( 3 ) and formula ( 4 ) , the final form of our training objective is : In order to distinguish the slight differences in semantics between different sentences , we propose a new self - supervised task which models the entailment relation of automatically generated triplet sentences . For each sentence si in the text dataset D , we first generate an external sentence s′i by masking contiguous segments of si with a masking rate of 20 % . Then we enlarge the masking area and get a new sentence s′′i with a masking rate of 40 % to si . The masking rates are set up experimentally , and an ablation study about the effect of masking rates is illustrated in Section 4.4 . An example of the masking procedure is shown as follows : L = Larc + λLtri ( 5 ) in which λ is a coefficient . 4 Experiments 4.1 Setups Evaluation Tasks We evaluate our method on two kinds of sentence related tasks : • Unsupervised Semantic Textual Similarity ( STS ): These tasks measure the model ’s ability to estimate the semantic similarities between sentences . si Al Jaber ’s first long distance travel was of 800 km which he covered by circling Qatar . • SentEval Transfer Tasks : These tasks measure the effectiveness of sentence embeddings used in downstream transfer tasks . s′i Al Jaber ’s first long distance travel was of 800 km which he covered by circling Qatar . Baselines We compare ArcCSE to several representative methods on STS and SentEval tasks , such as average GloVe embeddings ( Pennington et al . , 2014 ) , Skip - thought ( Kiros et al . , 2015 ) , average BERT embeddings from the last layer ( Devlin et al . , 2019 ) , BERT - Flow ( Li et al . , 2020 ) , and BERT - Whitening ( Su et al . , 2021 ) . We also include the recently proposed contrastive learning methods , such as ISBERT ( Zhang et al . , 2020 ) , CT - BERT ( Carlsson et al . , 2021 ) , ConSERT ( Yan et al . , 2021 ) , and the current state - of - the - art method SimCSE ( Gao et al . , 2021 ) . s′′i Al Jaber ’s first long distance travel was of 800 km which he covered by circling Qatar . We can constitute a triplet ( si , s′i , s′′i ) with entailment relation among them . Though in rare cases , the strategy may generate sentences that do not exhibit the desired relationship and introduce some noise , the entailment relation holds true most of the time . We expect encountering enough data will reinforce the correct ones whereas the impact of incorrect ones will diminish . Implementation Details We train ArcCSE with the pre - trained checkpoints of BERTbase and BERTlarge ( Devlin et al . , 2019 ) . We also employ our method to SBERT ( Reimers and Gurevych , 2019 ) , which has been trained on NLI datasets , to verify the generalizability of our method . Since the si , s′i and s′′i are similar literally and semantically , generating their representations with dropout noise may obscure their entailment relation and add inaccurate signals to the representation learning process . So we turn off the dropout of the encoder when modeling the triplet relation . Following SimCSE ( Gao et al . , 2021 ) , we use the output of the MLP layer on top of the [ CLS ] as Method STS12 STS13 STS14 STS15 STS16 STS - B SICK - R Avg .

We employ our method to BERT and SBERT in both base and large versions and report Spearman ’s correlation . the sentence representation during training , and use the [ CLS ] output without MLP layer for evaluation . The dropout rate is set to 0.1 . For ArcCon loss , we set the angular margin m to 10 degrees and the temperature τ to 0.05 . When modeling the entailment relation of triplet sentences , we set the masking ratios as 20 % and 40 % respectively . Since the semantic difference between triplet sentences is more obvious for long sentences , we filter out sentences with less than 25 words and use the left ones for the triplet loss . The loss coefficient λ is set to 0.1 experimentally . models and 1e-5 for large models . We search the batch size within { 8 , 16 , 32 } and always update the parameters every 64 steps . The model is optimized by the AdamW with Sharpness - Aware Minimization ( Foret et al . , 2021 ) and default configurations . We evaluate our model every 125 training steps on the development set of STS - B , and the best checkpoint is used for the final evaluation on test sets . Our implementation is based on HuggingFace ’s Transformers ( Wolf et al . , 2020 ) . 4.2 Unsupervised STS Tasks We use one million random sampled sentences from English Wikipedia for training , which has been used in previous work ( Gao et al . , 2021 ) 1 . During training , the sentences are sampled by length . We set different maximum sentence lengths for ArcCon loss and triplet loss to save memory . The length is set to 32 for the ArcCon loss in large models , and to the maximum length within a batch for all other cases . We train our model for one epoch and the learning rate is set to 3e-5 for base We conduct experiments on 7 semantic textual similarity ( STS ) tasks , including STS tasks 20122016 ( Agirre et al . , 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , 2015 , 2016 ) , STS Benchmark ( Cer et al . , 2017 ) , and SICKRelatedness ( Marelli et al . , 2014 ) . Within these datasets , each sample contains two sentences and a gold score between 0 and 5 which indicates their semantic similarity . We use SentEval toolkit ( Conneau and Kiela , 2018 ) for evaluation and report the Spearman ’s correlation following previous works ( Reimers and Gurevych , 2019 ; Gao et al . , 2021 ) . 1https://huggingface.co/datasets/princeton-nlp/datasetsThe evaluation results are shown in Table 1 , for - simcse / resolve / main / wiki1m_for_simcse.txt Method MR CR SUBJ MPQA SST TREC MRPC Avg .

We report the accuracy results of both BERTbase and BERTlarge level models . from which we can see that ArcCSE outperforms the previous approaches . Compared with the previous state - of - the - art method SimCSE , ArcCSEBERTbase raises the average Spearman ’s correlation from 76.25 % to 78.11 % , and ArcCSE - BERTlarge further pushes the results to 79.37 % . The performance is even better than strong supervised method SBERT , which has already been trained on NLI datasets . Furthermore , we can also employ our method to SBERT and improve its performance to 79.06 % and 80.69 % for the base and large models respectively , which is more effective than SimCSE . We also explore the improvements made by the ArcCon loss and triplet loss independently based on BERTbase . From Table 1 we can see that with ArcCon loss alone , the average Spearman ’s correlation is 77.25 % . When combining the traditional NT - Xent loss with our proposed triplet loss , the average Spearman ’s correlation is 77.02 % . Both of them outperform the previous state - of - the - art method SimCSE , whose average Spearman ’s correlation is 76.25 % . This demonstrates the effectiveness of ArcCon and triplet loss we proposed . The results are shown in Table 2 . We can see that ArcCSE performs on par or better than baseline methods in both BERTbase and BERTlarge level . This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in learning domain - specific sentence embeddings . 4.4 Ablation Studies Effect of Angular Margin The angular margin m in ArcCon loss affects the discriminative power directly . To investigate the effect of m , we conduct an experiment by varying m from 0 degrees to 20 degrees , increased by 2 degrees at each step . We tune the hyper - parameter based on Spearman ’s correlation on the development set of STS - B following previous works ( Kim et al . , 2021 ; Gao et al . , 2021 ) . The results are shown in Figure 4 . Figure 4 : Effect of the angular margin m in ArcCon loss . Results are reported on the development set of STS - B based on the Spearman ’s correlation . 4.3 SentEval Tasks We evaluate our model with SentEval toolkit on several supervised transfer tasks , including : MR ( Pang and Lee , 2005 ) , CR ( Hu and Liu , 2004 ) , SUBJ ( Pang and Lee , 2004 ) , MPQA ( Wiebe et al . , 2005 ) , SST-2 ( Socher et al . , 2013 ) , TREC ( Voorhees and Tice , 2000 ) and MRPC ( Dolan and Brockett , 2005 ) . For each task , SentEval trains a logistic regression classifier on top of the sentence embeddings and tests the performance on the downstream task . For a fair comparison , we do not include models with auxiliary tasks like masked language modeling . We can see that the best performance is achieved when m = 10 , either larger or smaller margin degrade the performance . This matches our intuition since small m may have little effect , and large m may negatively influence the positive pair relation modeling . Effect of Temperature The temperature τ in ArcCon Loss affects its effectiveness , so we carry out an experiment with τ varying from 0.01 to 0.1 , increased by 0.01 at each step . The results are shown in Figure 5 . We can see that the model ArcCSE - BERTbase STS12 STS13 STS14 STS15 STS16 STS - B SICK - R Avg . 72.08 70.51 69.62 84.27 83.59 83.13 76.25 75.85 74.42 82.32 82.30 82.15 79.54 78.87 78.39 79.92 78.74 78.39 72.39 71.58 70.89 78.11 77.35 76.71 w/ Dropouton / off w/ Dropoutmix / off w/ Dropouton / on Table 3 : Effect of on - off Switching of Dropout . We use different dropout settings to generate sentence embeddings used for ArcCon loss and triplet loss respectively . The " on " , " off " and " mix " mean turn dropout on , turn dropout off and use different settings for two passes separately . performs best when τ = 0.05 , so we use this value throughout our experiments . makes the triplet loss less helpful . The best performance is achieved when r1 is 20 % and r2 is 40 % , and the corresponding Spearman ’s correlation is 0.847 . We use them as our hyper - parameters . Effect of on - off Switching of Dropout The onoff switching of dropout in the BERT - like sentence encoder affects the generated sentence representations directly . Since dropout performs a kind of averaging over the ensemble of possible subnetworks , an embedding generated with dropout turned off can be seen as a kind of " averaging " representation , while an embedding generated with dropout turned on can be seen as generated through a subnetwork . In ArcCSE , we use the embeddings generated with the encoder dropout turned on as input for ArcCon loss , which regularizes the network by making representations generated through different subnetworks similar . When modeling the entailment relation , we generate " averaging " representations with dropout turn - off to avoid inaccurate signals . In order to verify our intuition , we conduct two experiments with different dropout settings . In the first experiment , we feed ArcCon two sentence representations generated with dropout turns on and off respectively . We carry out this experiment with angular margins ranging between 2 degrees to 12 degrees and report the best result . In the second one , we feed the triplet loss representations that are generated with dropout turns on and maintain the other settings . The results are shown in Table 3 . We can see that the original settings that turn dropout on for ArcCon and turn dropout off for triplet loss achieve the best performance , which confirms our intuition . Figure 5 : Effect of the temperature τ in ArcCon loss . Results are reported on the development set of STS - B based on the Spearman ’s correlation . Effect of Masking Ratios The masking ratios determine the sentences generated for the entailment relation modeling and their differences in semantics , so we conduct an experiment to explore the effect of different masking ratios . The first masking ratio r1 is varied from 10 % to 25 % , increased by 5 % for each step . The second masking ratio r2 is derived by adding an extra value rd to r1 . rd is varied from 10 % to 35 % , increased by 5 % for each step . The results are shown in Figure 6 . Figure 6 : Effect of the masking ratios . Different lines correspond to different values of r1 . The abscissa is rd , representing the difference between r1 and r2 . Results are reported on the development set of STS - B based on the Spearman ’s correlation . Effect of Coefficient in the Training Objective The coefficient λ in the final optimization objective adjusts the relative weights between ArcCon and the triplet loss , as shown in formula ( 5 ) . To find the most suitable λ , we conduct an experiment by varying λ from 0 to 1.2 and increased by 0.1 at each step . The results are shown in Figure 7 . We can see that large differences between the two masking ratios tend to lead lower Spearman ’s correlation compared to the smaller ones . The reason may be that the larger the semantic difference is , the easier for the model to estimate the entailment relations among the triplet sentences , which We can see that the best performance is achieved
