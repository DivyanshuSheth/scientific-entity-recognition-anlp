Following the pre-processing method in most prior
studies (Ma et al., 2016; Song et al., 2019; Zhou
et al., 2019), we divide each posts sequence into
a sequence of intervals to avoid excessively long
sequence. We chop a sequence Sinto intervals
based on three strategies: 1) fixed posts number,
2) fixed time length and 3) variable length in each
interval (Zhou et al., 2019). Hence Sis converted
toX={(x, t)}, where |X|is the number
of intervals, x={m,m, ...,m}and
t=τwhich is the timestamp of the lastpost
min the i-th interval. Then, we merge the
posts falling into the same interval as a single post.
We define the EARD task as automatically deter-
mining the earliest time ˆt∈ {t}, such that the
prediction ˆy∈ {0,1}atˆtfor a given claim is accu-
rate and remains unchanged afterwards with time
goes by. It is worthwhile to mention that since t
relates to the granularity of intervals, it might af-
fect the precision of a decision point based on the
formed intervals. In practice, however, we will try
to make the intervals small for keeping such impact
marginal.
5 HEARD Model
Figure 1 shows the architecture of HEARD, which
contains two components: 1) the rumor detection
component predicts rumor/non-rumor label at each
time step/interval; 2) the stabilization component
models the prediction stabilization process and de-
termines when to stop at the earliest detection point.We will describe them with detail in this section.
5.1 Rumor Detection Modeling
A standard LSTM cell (Hochreiter and Schmid-
huber, 1997) followed by a fully-connected layer
is utilized for rumor detection in each interval.
For any (x, t)∈X,xcan be turned into a
vector eby a text representation method, e.g.,
TF-IDF (Salton and Buckley, 1988), CNN (Kim,
2014), BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), etc.. Taking
eas input, the LSTM cell gets the hidden state
h=LSTM (e)and forwards it through the fully-
connected layer to perform prediction. The pre-
dicted class probability distribution of an instance
attis calculated as p=σ(Wh+b)and thus
the predicted class is ˆy=argmax (p), where σ(·),
Wandbare sigmoid function, weight matrix and
bias, respectively.
5.2 Stabilization Process Modeling
Prediction Inverse (PI). Our rumor detection com-
ponent keeps observing the posts stream and out-
puts a prediction sequence ˆy,ˆy,ˆy, . . .along the
time steps. During the process, newly arrived posts
may provide updated features rendering the next
decision of rumor detection to invert from rumor
to non-rumor or the other way round. Presumably,
the predictions would get stabilized when sufficient
clues are accumulated over time. By modeling such
a process, we aim to fix the earliest time twhen
the model can produce a stable prediction, meaning
that there will be no expected inverses of prediction4108410941104111411241134114411541164117
