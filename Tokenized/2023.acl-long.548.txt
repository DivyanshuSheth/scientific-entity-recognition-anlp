However ,   existing datasets are limited in size and cov-   erage , and are largely restricted to stereotypes   prevalent in the Western society . This is es-   pecially problematic as language technologies   gain hold across the globe . To address this   gap , we present SeeGULL , a broad - coverage   stereotype dataset , built by utilizing genera-   tive capabilities of large language models such   as PaLM , and GPT-3 , and leveraging a glob-   ally diverse rater pool to validate the preva-   lence of those stereotypes in society . SeeG-   ULL is in English , and contains stereotypes   about identity groups spanning 178 countries   across 8 different geo - political regions across   6 continents , as well as state - level identities   within the US and India . We also include   ﬁne - grained offensiveness scores for different   stereotypes and demonstrate their global dis-   parities . Furthermore , we include comparative   annotations about the same groups by anno-   tators living in the region vs. those that are   based in North America , and demonstrate that   within - region stereotypes about groups differ   from those prevalent in North America .   CONTENT WARNING : This paper contains   stereotype examples that may be offensive .   1 Introduction   Language technologies have recently seen impres-   sive gains in their capabilities and potential down-   stream applications , mostly aided by advancements   in large language models ( LLMs ) trained on web   data ( Bommasani et al . , 2021 ) . However , there is   also increasing evidence that these technologies   may reﬂect and propagate undesirable societal bi-   ases and stereotypes ( Kurita et al . , 2019 ; Shenget al . , 2019 ; Khashabi et al . , 2020 ; Liu et al . , 2019 ;   He et al . , 2020 ) . Stereotypes are generalized beliefs   about categories of people , and are often reﬂected   in data as statistical associations , which the lan-   guage models rely on to associate concepts . For in-   stance , Parrish et al . ( 2022 ) demonstrate that LLM-   based question - answer models rely on stereotypes   to answer questions in under - informative contexts .   Not all statistical associations learned from data   about a subgroup are stereotypes ; for instance , data   may associate women with both breast cancer and   nursing as a profession , but only the latter asso-   ciation is a commonly held stereotype ( Wilbourn   and Kee , 2010 ) . Recent work has built stereotype   benchmark datasets ( e.g. , StereoSet ( Nadeem et al . ,   2021 ) , CrowS - Pairs ( Nangia et al . , 2020 ) ) aimed   to detect such stereotypes in NLP model predic-   tions . While these datasets have been instrumental   in demonstrating that language models may rein-   force stereotypes , they have several key limitations .   First , they are limited in their size and coverage ,   especially for subgroups across the globe . Second ,   they are curated exclusively with manual effort ,   and are thus limited by the world - view of the data   creators and miss out stereotypes they might not   be aware of . Third , they do not qualify the stereo-   types with any associated harms or offense ( Blod-   gett et al . , 2021 ) . Finally , they assume a single   ground truth on whether a certain association is a   stereotype or not , whereas stereotypes often vary   from place to place . These limitations greatly re-   duce their utility in preventing stereotype harms in   language technologies in the global landscape .   In this paper , we show that we can leverage the   few - shot learning and generative capabilities of   LLMs to obtain a broad coverage set of stereotype9851   candidates . While prior studies demonstrating that   LLMs reproduce social stereotypes were in the   interest of evaluating them , we are instead tapping   into it as a capability of LLMs to generate a larger   and broader - coverage set of potential stereotypes .   We demonstrate that this approach works at a global   scale ( i.e. , across 178 countries ) as well as within   local contexts ( i.e. , state - level identities within the   US and India ) . We then employ a globally diverse   pool of annotators to obtain richer socially situated   validation of the generated stereotype candidates .   Our contributions are ﬁve - fold :   •A novel LLM - human partnership approach to   create large - scale broad - coverage eval datasets .   •The resulting dataset , SeeGULL ( Stereotypes   Generated Using LLMs in the Loop ) , contain-   ing 7750 stereotypes about 179 identity groups ,   across 178 countries , spanning 8 regions across 6   continents , as well as state - level identities within   2 countries : the US and India ( Figure 1 ) .   •We demonstrate SeeGULL ’s utility in detecting   stereotyping harms in the Natural Language Infer-   encing ( NLI ) task , with major gains for identity   groups in Latin America and Sub Saharan Africa .   •We obtain offensiveness ratings for a majority of   stereotypes in SeeGULL , and demonstrate that   identity groups in Sub - Saharan Africa , Middle   East , and Latin America have the most offensive   stereotypes about them .   •Through a carefully selected geographically di-   verse rater pool , we demonstrate that stereotypes   about the same groups vary substantially across   different social ( geographic , here ) contexts .   SeeGULL is not without its limitations ( see Sec-   tion 6 ) . The dataset is only in English , and is not   exhaustive . However , the approach we propose is   extensible to other regional contexts , as well as to   dimensions such as religion , race , and gender . Webelieve that tapping into LLM capabilities aided   with socially situated validations is a scalable ap-   proach towards more comprehensive evaluations .   2 Related Work   Stereotypes are beliefs and generalizations made   about the identity of a person such as their race ,   gender , and nationality . Categorizing people into   groups with associated social stereotypes is a re-   occurring cognitive process in our everyday lives   ( Quinn et al . , 2007 ) . Decades of social scientiﬁc   studies have led to developing several frameworks   for understanding dimensions of social stereotyp-   ing ( Fiske et al . , 2018 ; Koch et al . , 2016 ; Abele and   Wojciszke , 2014 ; Osgood et al . , 1957 ) . However ,   nuances of social stereotypes manifested in real-   world data can not be uniquely explored through   any single framework ( Abele et al . , 2021 ) . Most   classic studies of stereotypes rely on theory - driven   scales and checklists . Recent data - driven , bottom-   up approaches capture dynamic , context - dependent   dimensions of stereotyping . For instance , Nicolas   et al . ( 2022 ) propose an NLP - driven approach for   capturing spontaneous social stereotypes .   With the advances in NLP , speciﬁcally with sig-   niﬁcant development of LLMs in recent years , a   large body of work has focused on understand-   ing and evaluating their potential risks and harms   ( Chang et al . , 2019 ; Blodgett et al . , 2020 ; Bender   et al . , 2021 ; Weidinger et al . , 2022 ) . Language   models such as BERT and GPT-2 have been shown   to exhibit societal biases ( Sheng et al . , 2019 ; Ku-   rita et al . , 2019 ) ; and RoBERTa ( Liu et al . , 2019 ) ,   and De - BERTA ( He et al . , 2020 ) have been shown   to rely on stereotypes to answer questions(Parrish   et al . , 2022 ) , to cite a few examples .   To address this issue , there has been signiﬁcant9852work on building evaluation datasets for stereo-   types , using combinations of crowd - sourcing and   web - text scraping . Some notable work in En-   glish language include StereoSet ( Nadeem et al . ,   2021 ) , that has stereotypes across 4 different di-   mensions – race , gender , religion , and profession ;   CrowS - Pairs ( Nangia et al . , 2020 ) , which is a   crowd - sourced dataset that contains sentences cov-   ering 9 dimensions such as race , gender , and na-   tionality . Névéol et al . ( 2022 ) introduce French   CrowS - Pairs containing stereotypical and anti-   stereotypical sentence - pairs in French . Bhatt et al .   ( 2022 ) cover stereotypes in the Indian context . Ad-   ditionally , there are studies that have collected   stereotypes for different sub - groups as part of so-   cial psychological research ( Borude , 1966 ; Koch   et al . , 2018 ; Rogers and Wood , 2010 ) . While   they add immense value to measuring stereotyp-   ing harms , the above datasets are limited in that   they contain stereotypes only widely known in one   speciﬁc region ( such as the United States , or In-   dia ) , are small in size with limited coverage of   stereotypes , and reﬂect limited world views . ( such   as the Western context ) . Alternately , for scalable   downstream evaluations of fairness of models , ar-   tiﬁcially constructed datasets ( Dev et al . , 2020 ; Li   et al . , 2020 ; Zhao et al . , 2018 ) that test for prefer-   ential association of descriptive terms with speciﬁc   identity group in tasks such as question answering   and natural language inference , have been used .   While they typically target stereotypical associa-   tions , they lack ground knowledge to differentiate   them from spurious correlations , leading to vague   measurements of ‘ bias ’ ( Blodgett et al . , 2020 ) .   Building resources with broad coverage of both   identities of persons , and social stereotypes about   them is pivotal towards holistic estimation of a   model ’s safety when deployed . We demonstrate a   way to achieve this coverage at scale by simulating   a free - response , open - ended approach for capturing   social stereotypes in a novel setting with LLMs .   3 SeeGULL : Benchmark Creation   Large Language Models ( LLMs ) are pre - trained   on a subset of the real - world data ( Chowdhery   et al . , 2022 ; Brown et al . , 2020 ; He et al . , 2020 )   which contains both implicit and explicit stereo-   types ( Bolukbasi et al . , 2016 ) . This makes LLMs   a good candidate for generating stereotypes about   geographical identity groups that exist around the   globe . However , since generative models also gen - eralize well beyond the training data , they can gen-   erate statistical associations that look like stereo-   types but are instead statistical noise . To ﬁlter out   such stereotypical - looking noisy associations , we   leverage a globally diverse rater - pool to validate the   prevalence of the generated stereotype candidates   in the society . We use a novel LLM - human partner-   ship to create a broad - coverage stereotype bench-   mark , SeeGULL : Stereotypes Generated Using   LLMs in the Loop , that captures a subset of the   real - world stereotypes .   Our focus in this paper is on broad geo-   cultural coverage of stereotype evaluation in   English NLP for two primary reasons . First ,   English NLP sees disproportionately more re-   search / resources / benchmarks , and is increasingly   being deployed in products across the globe . Hence   there is an immediate need for making evaluation   resources ( including stereotype benchmarks ) in En-   glish itself that have global / cross - cultural coverage .   Secondly , this is in line with recent calls ( Hovy and   Yang , 2021 ; Hershcovich et al . , 2022 ; Prabhakaran   et al . , 2022 ) to look beyond cross - lingual NLP and   build cross - cultural competence in AI / NLP .   Our work is a ﬁrst step towards this goal w.r.t .   stereotype evaluations , and we envision future work   expanding it to multilingual coverage . There are two   main steps in creating SeeGULL : ( i ) Stereotype   generation using LLMs , and ( ii ) Human validation   of the generated associations . Figure 2 presents an   overview of the overall approach .   3.1 Stereotype Generation Using LLMs   In this section we describe sequentially the process   towards generation of SeeGULL .   Seed Set Selection To generate stereotypes at   a global geo - cultural scale , we consider 8 differ-   ent regions based on the UN SDG groupings : ( i )   Sub - Saharan Africa , ( ii ) Middle East ( composed   of Northern Africa and Western Asia ) , ( iii ) South   Asia ( composed of Central and Southern Asia ) , ( iv )   East Asia ( composed of Eastern and South - Eastern   Asia ) , ( v ) Latin America ( includes the Caribbean ) ,   ( vi ) Australia ( includes New Zealand ) , ( vii ) North   America , and ( viii ) Europe . The countries are   grouped based on geographic regions as deﬁned by   the United Nations Statistics Division .   The above 8 regions constitute the Global ( G )   axis . We also generate local ( L ) stereotypes for9853   State - level identities for India and the United States .   We select states from India and the US as the cul-   tural differences in their states and stereotypes are   well documented and publicly available . We use   existing stereotype sources and construct separate   seed sets for the above axes . Table 1 presents these   sources . ( See Appendix A.2 for details ) . We man-   ually selected 100 seed examples for generating   stereotypes for the Global axis . For the State - level   axis , we selected 22 and 60 seed stereotype exam-   ples for US and India , respectively .   Few - shot Prompting We leverage the few - shot   generative property of LLMs ( Brown et al . , 2020 )   to generate potential stereotype candidates similar   to the seed set shown in Figure 2 , albeit with a   broader coverage of identity groups and attributes .   We use generative LLMs PaLM 540B ( Chowdhery   et al . , 2022 ) , GPT-3 ( Brown et al . , 2020 ) , and T0   ( Sanh et al . , 2021 ) and prompt them with nknown   stereotypical associations of the form ( identity ( i d ) ,   attribute ( attr ) ) , whereiddenotes the global and   the state - level identity groups , and attr denotes   the associated descriptive attribute terms ( adjec-   tive / adjective phrase , or a noun / noun phrase ) .   For a total of Nalready known stereotypes in the   seed set , we select all possible stereotype combi-   nations ofn= 2and prompt the model 5 different   times for the same input stereotype ( τ= 0.5 ) . We   experimented with n∈[1,5]and observed that the   number of unique stereotype candidates generated   decreased on increasing the number of examples n   in the input prompt . A greater number of example   stereotypes as input primed the LLMs to be more   constrained resulting in fewer potential stereotype   candidates . To ensure quality as well as diversity   of the generated stereotype candidates , we select   n= 2for our experiments . ( See Appendix A.3 for   details ) . Figure 2 demonstrates the different promptvariants we use for our experiments . We also re-   order the stereotypical associations for each variant   to generate more diverse outputs and prompt the   model for a total of / parenleftbig / parenrightbig   ×5×2for any given seed   set . ( See Appendix A.4 for details ) .   Post - processing While most generated outputs   contained tuples of the form ( id , attr ) , they were   sometimes mixed with other generated text . We ex-   tract potential stereotype candidates of the form ( i d ,   attr ) using regular expression . We remove plurals ,   special characters , and duplicates by checking for   reﬂexivity of the extracted stereotype candidates .   We also mapped identity groups to their adjectival   and demonymic forms for both the Global ( G ) and   the State - level ( L ) axis – to different countries for   theG , and to different US states and Indian states   for the L. This results in a total of 80,977 unique   stereotype candidates across PaLM , GPT-3 , and   T0 , for both the axes combined .   Salience Score Since a single identity group can   be associated with multiple attribute terms ( both   spurious and stereotypical ) , we ﬁnd the salience   score of stereotype candidates within each coun-   try or state . The salience ( SL ) score denotes how   uniquely an attribute is associated with a demonym   of a country . The higher the salience score , more   unique the association as generated by the LLM .   We ﬁnd the salience score of a stereotype candidate   using a modiﬁed tf - idf metric .   salience = tf(attr , c ) · idf(attr , R )   For the Global axis , the function tf(attr , c ) de-   notes the smoothed relative frequency of attribute   attr in countryc , s.t . ,c∈RwhereRis set   of regions deﬁned in Section 3.1 ; The function   idf(attr , R ) , on the other hand , is the inverse doc-   ument frequency of the attribute term attr in re-   gionRdenoting the importance of the attribute9854attr across all regions . We follow a similar ap-   proach for the State - level ( L ) axis and compute the   salience score for Indian and the US states .   3.2 Validation of the Generated Stereotypes   Candidate selection . In order to ﬁlter out rare   and noisy tuples , as well as to ensure that we vali-   date the most salient associations in our data , we   choose the stereotype candidates for validation as   per their saliency score . Furthermore , in order to   ensure that the validated dataset has a balanced dis-   tribution across identities and regions , we chose the   top 1000 candidates per region , while maintaining   the distribution across different countries within   regions as in the full dataset . A similar approach   was followed for the axis L as well .   Annotating Prevalence of Stereotypes Stereo-   types are not absolute but situated in context of   individual experiences of persons and communi-   ties , and so , we hypothesize that the annotators   identifying with or closely familiar with the iden-   tity group present in the stereotype will be more   aware of the existing stereotype about that sub-   group . Therefore , we obtain socially situated ‘ in-   region ’ annotations for stereotype candidates con-   cerning identities from a particular region by re-   cruiting annotators who also reside in that same   region . This means , for the Global ( G ) axis , we   recruited annotators from each of the 8 respective   regions , whereas for Local ( L ) axis , we recruited   annotators residing in India and the US . Each can-   didate was annotated by 3 annotators . We asked   annotators to label each stereotype candidate tuple   ( id , attr ) based on their awareness of a commonly-   held opinion about the target identity group . We   emphasized that they were not being asked whether   they hold or agree with a stereotype , rather about   the prevalence of the stereotype in society . The   annotators select one of the following labels :   •Stereotypical ( S ) : If the attribute term ex-   hibits a stereotype for people belonging to   an identity group e.g. ( French , intelligent ) .   •Non - Stereotypical ( N ) : If the attribute term   is a factual / deﬁnitional association , a noisy   association , or not a stereotypical association   for the identity group e.g. ( Irish , Ireland )   •Unsure ( with justiﬁcation ) ( U ) : If the anno-   tator is not sure about any existing association   between the attribute and the identity .   Since stereotypes are subjective , we follow the   guidelines outlined by Prabhakaran et al . ( 2021)and do not take majority voting to decide stereo-   types among candidate associations . Instead , we   demonstrate the results on different stereotype   thresholds . A stereotype threshold θdenotes the   number of annotators in a group who annotate a   tuple as a stereotype . For example , θ= 2indicates   that at least 2 annotators annotated a tuple as a   stereotype . With the subjectivity of annotations in   mind , we release the individual annotations in the   full dataset , so that the appropriate threshold for   a given task , or evaluation objective can be set by   the end user ( Díaz et al . , 2022 ; Miceli et al . , 2020 ) .   We had a total of 89 annotators from 8 regions   and 16 countries , of whom 43 were female iden-   tifying , 45 male identifying , and 1 who identiﬁed   as non - binary . We describe this annotation task   in more detail in Appendix A.6 , including the de-   mographic diversity of annotators which is listed   in Appendix A.6.2 . Annotators were professional   data labelers working as contractors for our vendor   and were compensated at rates above the preva-   lent market rates , and respecting the local regu-   lations regarding minimum wage in their respec-   tive countries . We spent USD 23,100 for annota-   tions , @USD 0.50 per tuple on average . Our hourly   payout to the vendors varied across regions , from   USD 8.22 in India to USD 28.35 in Australia .   4 SeeGULL : Characteristics and Utility   In this section we discuss the characteristics , cover-   age , and utility of the resource created .   4.1 Dataset Comparison and Characteristics   Table 1 presents the dataset characteristics for   stereotype benchmarks for a comprehensive eval-   uation . The existing stereotype benchmarks such9855   as StereoSet ( Nadeem et al . , 2021 ) , CrowS - Pairs   ( Nangia et al . , 2020 ) , and UNESCO ( Klineberg ,   1951 ) capture stereotypes about Global ( G ) identity   groups ; Koch ( Koch et al . , 2018 ) , Borude ( Borude ,   1966 ) , and Bhatt ( Bhatt et al . , 2022 ) only capture   State - level ( L ) stereotypes either about US states   or Indian states . SeeGULL captures the Global ( G )   stereotypes for 179 global identity groups as well as   State - level ( L ) stereotypes for 50 US states and 31   Indian states . Appendix A.7 shows the distribution   of identity groups for 8 regions – Europe ( EU ) , East   Asia ( EA ) , South Asia ( SA ) , Sub - Saharan Africa   ( AF ) , Latin America ( LA ) , Middle East ( ME ) , Aus-   tralia ( AU ) , and North America ( NA ) , and the US   states ( US ) , and Indian ( IN ) states .   Overall , SeeGULL contains 7750 tuples for the   Global axis that are annotated as stereotypes ( S )   by at least one annotator . It covers regions largely   ignored in existing benchmarks like LA ( 756 ) , EA   ( 904 ) , AU ( 708 ) , AF ( 899 ) and ME ( 787 ) . ( Note :   The numbers in parenthesis denote the number of   stereotypes ) . Figure 3 presents the number of in-   region stereotypes for the Global ( G ) axis for dif-   ferent stereotype thresholds θ= [ 1,3 ] . ( See ap-   pendix A.7 for state - level stereotypes ) . Most re-   gions have hundreds of tuples that two out of three   annotators agreed to be stereotypes , with Europe   and Sub Saharan Africa having the most : 690 and   739 , respectively . Furthermore , 1171 tuples had   unanimous agreement among the three annotators .   SeeGULL also captures the regional sensitivity   ( RS ) of stereotype perceptions by situating them   in different societal contexts ( described in Sec-   tion 5.1 ) , unlike existing benchmarks that present   stereotypes only in a singular context . Addition-   ally , SeeGULL quantiﬁes the offensiveness of the   annotated stereotypes and provides ﬁne - grained of-   fensiveness ( O ) ratings ( Section 5.2 ) which are also   missing in existing benchmarks . Table 2 presents a   sample of the SeeGULL dataset with the salience   score ( SL ) , # stereotype annotations in the region   ( In(S ) ) as well as outside the region(Out(S ) ) , along   with their the mean offensiveness ( O ) rating . We   discuss more about the latter annotations in Section   5 . Table 11 presents more detailed examples .   4.2 Evaluating Harms of Stereotyping   SeeGULL provides a broader coverage of stereo-   types and can be used for a more comprehensive   evaluation of stereotype harms . To demonstrate   this , we follow the methodology proposed by Dev   et al . ( 2020 ) and construct a dataset for measuring   embedded stereotypes in the NLI models .   Using the stereotypes that have been validated   by human annotators in the SeeGULL benchmark ,   we randomly pick an attribute term for each of the   179 global identity groups ( spanning 8 regions ) .   We construct the hypothesis - premise sentence   pairs such that each sentence contains either the   identity group or its associated attribute term . For   example , for the stereotype ( Italian , seductive ):   Premise : Aseductive person bought a coat .   Hypothesis : An Italian person bought a coat .   We use 10 verbs and 10 objects to create the   above sentence pairs . The ground truth association   for all the sentences in the dataset is ‘ neutral ’ . For a   fair comparison , we construct similar datasets using   the regional stereotypes present in existing bench-   marks : StereoSet ( SS ) and CrowS - Pairs ( CP ) . We   also establish a neutral baseline ( NB ) for our exper-   iments by creating a dataset of random associations9856   between an identity group and an attribute term .   We evaluate 3 pre - trained NLI models for stereo-   typing harms using the above datasets : ( i ) ELMo   ( Peters et al . , 2018 ) , ( ii ) XLNet ( Yang et al . , 2019 ) ,   and ( iii ) ELECTRA ( Clark et al . , 2020 ) and present   the results in Table 3 . We measure the mean entaile-   ment M(E ) = P(entail ) /|D|and % Entailed ( % E )   for the above NLI models to evaluate the strength   of the stereotypes embedded in them . The higher   the value , the greater the potential of stereotyping   harm by the model .   From Table 3 , we observe that the M(E ) for the   Global axis is higher when evaluating the mod-   els using SeeGULL . Except for East Asia ( EA ) ,   SeeGULL results in a higher % E across all models   ( at least 2X more globally , at least 10X more for   Latin America ( LA ) , and at least 5X more for Sub-   Saharan Africa ( AF ) ) . We also uncover embedded   stereotypes for Australia in the NLI models , which   are completely missed by the existing benchmarks .   Overall , SeeGULL results in a more comprehen-   sive evaluation of stereotyping in these language   models , and thus allows for more caution to be   made when deploying models in global settings .   While here we only present results indicating im-   provement in coverage of measurements in NLI ,   the stereotype tuples in SeeGULL can also be used   for evaluating different tasks ( such as question an-   swering , document similarity , and more ) , as well   for employing mitigation strategies which rely on   lists of words ( Ravfogel et al . , 2020 ; Dev et al . ,   2021 ) . We leave this for future work.5 Socially Situated Stereotypes   5.1 Regional Sensitivity of Stereotypes   Stereotypes are socio - culturally situated and vary   greatly across regions , communities , and contexts ,   impacting social interactions through harmful emo-   tions and behaviors such as hate and prejudice   ( Cuddy et al . , 2008 ) . We hypothesize that the sub-   jective and the contextual nature of stereotypes   result in a varied perception of the same stereotype   across different regions . For example , a stereotyp-   ical tuple ( Indians , smell like curry ) might only   be known to Indian annotators residing outside of   India , but they might not be aware of the regional   stereotypes present within contemporary India . To   capture these nuances and differences across differ-   ent societies , we obtain additional annotations for   salient stereotype candidates from 3 ‘ out - region ’   annotators for the Global ( G ) axis . For each region   in the Global ( G ) axis other than North America ,   we recruited annotators who identify themselves   with an identity group in that region but reside   in North America . We use North America as the   reference in this work due to the ease of annota-   tor availability of different identities . Future work   should explore this difference w.r.t . other contexts .   The annotation task and cost here is the same as in   Section 3.2 , and is also described in Appendix A.6 .   Figure 4 demonstrates the agreement and the sen-   sitivity of stereotypes captured in SeeGULL across   the in - region and out - region annotators for 7 differ-   ent regions ( θ= 2 ) for the Global axis : namely Eu-   rope , East Asia , South Asia , Australia , Middle East,9857   Sub - Saharan Africa , and the Middle East . It demon-   strates the difference in the stereotype perceptions   across the two groups of annotators . We see that at   least 10 % of the stereotypes are only prevalent out-   side the region , e.g. : ( French , generous ) , ( Danish ,   incoherent ) , ( Indians , smelly ) , ( Afghans , beautiful ) ;   some other stereotypes are prevalent only in the   region , e.g. : ( Swiss , ambivalent ) , ( Portuguese , sea-   farer ) , ( Danish , music lovers ) , ( Afghans , stubborn ) ,   ( Nepalese , slow ) , and there is at least a 10 % overlap   ( across all regions ) for stereotypes that are preva-   lent both within and outside the region , e.g. : ( Ital-   ian , gangsters ) , ( German , Nazis ) , ( Pakistani , con-   servative ) , ( Afghans , brutal ) , ( Indians , poor ) . ( See   Figure A.8 for agreement for thresholds θ= 1,3 ) .   5.2 Offensiveness of Stereotypes   A stereotype makes generalized assumptions about   identities of people . While all stereotypes are thus   reductive , some can be more offensive than oth-   ers based on the generalization ( for instance , if the   association is about criminal conduct ) . Each stereo-   type tuple in our dataset contains an attribute term   that describes a generalization made about the iden-   tity group . To understand the offensiveness of the   generated stereotypes , we obtain annotations for   the attribute terms and impute them to the stereo-   types . We have a total of 12,171 unique attribute   terms for all identity groups across the global and   state - level axes combined . Each attribute term is   either an adjective / adjective phrase or a noun / noun   phrase . We compute the association frequency   for each attribute term by calculating the number   of stereotype candidates its associated with . Thehigher the number , the more stereotypes we can   get offensiveness annotations for . We then sort the   attribute terms in decreasing order of their associ-   ation frequency and select the top 1800 attribute   words and phrases , which obtains ~85 % coverage   of our entire dataset .   Since all the attributes are in English , for this   task , annotators were recruited only in one region ,   North America , and the requirement for annotation   was proﬁciency in English reading and writing . We   obtain annotations for each attribute term from 3   annotators who are proﬁcient in English reading   and writing . We ask how offensive would the given   attribute be , if it were associated as a generalization   about a group of people , i.e. , ‘ Most idareattr ’ ,   whereidis an identity group such as Australians ,   Mexicans , etc . , and attr is the given attribute term   such as ‘ lazy ’ , or ‘ terrorist ’ . The task is subjective   in nature and the annotators are expected to label   an attribute on a Likert scale ranging from ‘ Not   offensive ( −1 ) ’ , ‘ Unsure 0 ’ , ‘ Slightly Offensive   ( +1 ) ’ , ‘ Somewhat Offensive ( +2 ) ’ , ‘ Moderately   Offensive ( +3 ) ’ , to ‘ Extremely Offensive ( +4 ) .   This task is described in more detail in Appendix   A.9 . Annotators were paid for this task according to   local regulations in the country they were recruited   in , as described in Section 3.2 .   We share the mean rating across 3 annotators   for each attribute as well as individual annota-   tions . These ratings of offensiveness of attributes   are mapped back to individual identities , the at-   tribute is stereotypically associated with , denoting   an interpretation of the offensiveness of the stereo-   types . Table 4 shows some examples of the at-9858   tributes along with their mean offensiveness scores   and their commonly associated identity groups . At-   tributes like ‘ gangsters ’ , ‘ killers ’ , ‘ terrorist ’ , were   annotated as ‘ Extremely Offensive ( +4 ) ’ by all the   annotators , whereas ‘ patriotic ’ , ‘ rich ’ , ‘ kind ’ were   considered ‘ Not Offensive ( -1 ) ’ by all the annota-   tors . On the other hand , attributes such as ‘ smell   bad ’ , ‘ poor ’ , ‘ dishonest ’ , ‘ rude ’ were more subjec-   tive and had ratings ranging from ‘ Not Offensive ’   to ‘ Extremely Offensive ’ across the 3 annotators .   From Figure 5 , we also observe that the region of   Sub - Saharan Africa has the most offensive stereo-   types followed by the Middle East , Latin America ,   South Asia , East Asia , North America and ﬁnally   Europe . Pakistan , as a country , has the most offen-   sive stereotypes followed by Mexico , Cameroon ,   Afghanistan , and Ethiopia . Australians , Indians ,   Japanese , Brazilians and New Zealanders have the   least offensive stereotypes ( See Appendix A.9.4 for   offensiveness distribution of stereotypes).6 Conclusion   We employ a novel LLM - human partnership based   approach to create a unique stereotype benchmark ,   SeeGULL , that covers a geo - culturally broad range   of stereotypes about 179 identity groups spanning   8 different regions and 6 continents . In addition   to stereotypes at a global level for nationality , the   dataset also contains state - level stereotypes for 50   US states , and 31 Indian states and union territories .   We leverage the few - shot capabilities of LLMs such   as PaLM , GPT-3 , and T0 and get a salience score   that demonstrates the uniqueness of the associa-   tions as generated by LLMs . We also get annota-   tions from a geographically diverse rater pool and   demonstrate the contextual nature and the regional   sensitivity of these stereotypes . Further , we investi-   gate the offensiveness of the stereotypes collected   in the dataset . The scale and coverage of the dataset   enable development of different fairness evaluation   paradigms that are contextual , decentralized from   a Western focus to a global perspective , thus en-   abling better representation of global stereotypes in   measurements of harm in language technologies .   Limitations   Although , we uncover and collate a broad - range of   stereotypes , it is not without limitations . Firstly , we   generate stereotypes using seeds which inﬂuence   and skew the output stereotypes retrieved . Our cov-   erage could thus be greatly affected and potentially   increased with different or more seed stereotypes .   Secondly , stereotypes are inherently subjective in   nature and even though we do get 6 annotations   from annotators residing in different regions , they   have a limited world view and might not be aware   of all the existing stereotypes . Additionally , cer-   tain stereotypes make sense only in context . For   example the stereotype ( Asians , hardworking ) is   not offensive by itself but becomes problematic   when we compare or rank Asians with other social   groups . Moreover , the stereotype ( Asians , socially   awkward ) exists in tandem with the former stereo-   type which is offensive . Although we do capture   regional sensitivity of stereotypes , our work does   not capture the contextual information around these   stereotypes . For capturing in - region vs out - region   stereotypes , we only select annotators from North   America but the out - region annotators can belong   to any of the other regions as well . That is out-   side the scope of this work . Additionally , we em-   phasise that this work is not a replacement to the9859more participatory work done directly with differ-   ent communities to understand the societal context   and the associated stereotypes . The complemen-   tary usage of our method with more community   engaged methods can lead to broader coverage of   evaluations of harm ( Dev et al . , 2023 ) .   Ethics Statement   We generate and validate stereotypical associations   about a person ’s identity based on the geographi-   cal location they are from . Geographic identity is   a complex notion and a person can identify with   more than one location , and subsequently culture .   This identity also can have signiﬁcant overlap with   other identities such as religion or race and that also   colors experiences and stereotypes experienced .   We develop this dataset as a ﬁrst step towards in-   cluding a fraction of the complex stereotypes expe-   rienced across the world and hope for future work   to build on it to include more ( and more complex )   stereotypes so that our models and systems can   be evaluated more rigorously . Hence , SeeGULL   should be used only for diagnostic and research   purposes , and not as benchmarks to prove lack of   bias . The paper also contains stereotypes that can   be offensive and triggering and will be released   with appropriate trigger warnings .

A.2 Stereotype Sources for Creating Seed Set   •StereoSet ( Nadeem et al . , 2021):Stereoset   contains stereotypes about race , gender , pro-   fessions , and religion . We randomly select 50   sentence pairs from the ’ race ’ category as it   contains stereotypical sentences about differ-   ent nationalities . We then manually extract tu-   ples of the form ( identity , attribute ) from these   sentences . For example , one of the stereotyp-   ical sentences about the target ‘ Ghanaian ’ is   ‘ He was skinny and malnourished ’ . We extract   the two stereotypes – ( Ghanaian , skinny ) , and   ( Ghanaian , malnourished ) from this sentence .   We extract 30 such stereotypical tuples from   the StereoSet dataset for the global axis .   •UNESCO ( Klineberg , 1951 ): They listed out   adjectives that were most frequently used   to describe Russians , Americans , British ,   French , Chinese , Australians , Germans , Ital-   ians , Dutch , Norwegians , and Americans . The   description of the above nationality were col-   lected from Australians , British , French , Ger-   mans , Italians , Dutch , Norwegians , and Amer-   icans . There were 70 such ( identity , attribute )   pairs and we extract all of it to create the seed   set for the global axis .   •Koch ( Koch et al . , 2018 ): They highlight   participant - generated stereotypes describing   inter - state prejudice as held by the US citizens   about different US states on a 2D cognitive   map . We assume each dimension of the map   to be an attribute that is associated with differ-   ent US states . We extract 22 such stereotypes   about US states .   •Borude ( Borude , 1966 ): They surveyed 238   subjects and highlight the 5 most frequent   traits about Gujaratis , Bengalis , Goans , Kan - nadigas , Kashmiris , Marathis , and Punjabis .   The traits can be viewed as attributes associ-   ated with the mentioned identity groups . We   collect 35 ( identity , attribute ) pairs as seed set   forIndian states .   •Bhatt ( Bhatt et al . , 2022 ): The paper presents   stereotypes held about different states in In-   dia by Indian citizens . We select 15 seed ex-   amples for Indian States where there was an   annotator consensus .   Table 5 presents the number of seed examples used   from the above sources .   A.3 N - shot Analysis   To ﬁnd the most optimal nforn - shot prompting ,   we randomly select 100 examples from / parenleftbig / parenrightbig   com-   binations and prompt the model 5 times for each   example . Table 6 shows the # stereotype candidates ,   # identity groups ( I d ) , and # attribute terms(Attr )   for different values of ‘ n ’ . To ensure quality as well   as diversity of the generated stereotype candidates ,   we selectn= 2for our experiments .   A.4 Different types of input variants for   prompting LLMs   •Identity - Attribute pair ( identity , attribute ): In-   put stereotypes of the form ( x , y),(x , y )   and(x , y),(x , y)where the model is ex-   pected to generate more stereotypical tuples   of the form ( identity , attribute ) .   •Attribute - Identity pair ( attribute , identity ): In-   put stereotypes of the form ( y , x),(y , x )   and(y , x),(y , x)where the model is   asked to generate stereotypes of the form ( at-   tribute , identity ) .   •Target identity ( identity , attribute , iden-   tity ): Input stereotypes of the form   ( x , y),(x , y),(x , where the model is   asked to complete the attribute for a given   target identity group xwhile also generating   more stereotypical tuples of the form ( x , y ) .   •Target attribute ( attribute , identity , at-   tribute ): Input stereotypes of the form   ( y , x),(y , x),(y , where the model is   asked to complete the target identity group for   the given attribute and generate more stereo-   typical tuples of the form ( y , x ) .   Table 7 demonstrated examples the above input   types and examples of the input variants.9863   A.5 Steps for Post - processing   •Use regex to extract tuples either of the form   ( identity , attribute ) from the generated text .   • Remove unnecessary characters like " [ |"|’|].| "   etc . , and numbers from strings so that it only   contains alphabets [ a - z][A - Z ] and hyphens ( - ) .   •Remove tuples where # ( elements ) /negationslash= 2as it   is most likely noise .   •Remove duplicates of the form ( x , y)and   ( y , x)by checking for reﬂexivity in the tuples .   •Remove noise by mapping identity terms to its   adjectival and demonymic forms for different   states for ‘ Indian states ’ , and ‘ US states ’ axis ,   and countries for the ‘ Global .   •Remove duplicate attributes associated with a   given identity group by removing plurals and   attribute words ending in ‘ -ing ’ .   A.6 Annotating Prevalence of Stereotypes   We describe here the annotation task speciﬁcally   for annotating if a given tuple is a stereotype   present in the society .   A.6.1 Task Description   Given a set of tuples ( identity term , associated to-   ken ) for the annotation , the annotators are expected   to label each tuple as either a Stereotype ( S ) , Not a   stereotype ( NS ) , and Unsure ( Unsure ) . This same   task was provided to annotators for tasks described   in Sections 3.2 and 5 . Note : The annotators are not   being asked whether they believe in the stereotypeor not , rather whether they know that such a stereo-   type about the identity group exists in society . The   labels and their signiﬁcance is provided in Table 8 .   A.6.2 Annotator Demographic Distribution   Our annotator pool was fairly distributed across   regional identities . Table 9 and Table 10 show   the annotator distribution across different regions   and for different ethnicity , respectively . We cap-   ture in - region and out - region ratings separately in   the dataset , hence avoiding any US - skew . To be   precise , we had 2 groups of annotators : ( i ) We   recruited annotators from 16 countries across 8 cul-   tural regions to annotate stereotypes about regional   identities from corresponding regions ( e.g. , South   Asian raters from South Asia annotating stereo-   types about South Asians ) ( Section 3.2 ) . ( ii ) We   recruited a separate set of annotators residing in   the US but identifying with the other seven re-   gional identities to study out - region annotations   ( Section 5.1 ) , i.e. , South Asian raters from the US   annotating stereotypes about South Asians . Note :   Table 9 combines these pools , resulting in a higher   number of annotators from the US .   A.6.3 Cost of Annotation   Annotators were professional data labelers work-   ing as contractors for our vendor and were com-   pensated at rates above the prevalent market rates ,   and respecting the local regulations regarding min-   imum wage in their respective countries . We spent   USD 23,100 for annotations , @USD 0.50 per tu-   ple on average . Our hourly payout to the vendors   varied across regions , from USD 8.22 in India to   USD 28.35 in Australia .   A.7 Coverage of Identity Groups and   Stereotypes   Identity Coverage We deﬁne coverage as the   number of different unique identity groups that   have annotated stereotypes and compare the cov-   erage of different identity groups in SeeGULL9864   with existing benchmark datasets – StereoSet ( SS ) ,   CrowS - Pairs ( CP ) , Koch , Borude , and Bhatt . For   SS and CP , we consider two variants – the original   dataset ( SS(O ) and CP(O ) ) and the demonyms only   version of the dataset ( SS(D ) and CP(D ) . From   Figure 6 , we observe that we cover 179 identity   groups in SeeGULL whereas CP(D ) and SS(D )   only cover 24 and 23 identity groups , respectively .   The other datasets have far fewer identity terms .   We cover unique identity groups in regions like   Latin America , East Asia , Australia , and Africa   which is missing in the existing datasets . SeeG-   ULL also has stereotypes for people residing in   50 US states ( like New - Yorkers , Californians , Tex-   ans , etc . , ) and 31 Indian states and union territories   ( like Biharis , Assamese , Tamilians , Bengalis , etc . , )   which are missing in existing datasets ( Figure 7 ) .   Stereotype Coverage Figure 8 demonstrates the   number of stereotypes in SeeGULL for the state-   level axis for the US and Indian States . The ﬁg-   ures show the # stereotypes for different stereotype   thresholdsθ= [ 1,3].9865   A.8 Regional Sensitivity of Stereotypes for   Different Thresholds   Figure 9 demonstrates the regional sensitivity of   stereotypes via annotator agreement across in-   region and out - region annotations for different   stereotype thresholds θ= [ 1,3]for 7 regions .   A.9 Annotating Offensiveness of Stereotypes   We describe here the task of annotating how offen-   sive a given attribute term is .   A.9.1 Task Description   The annotators are required to label each attribute   as one of the following on a likert scale : ( i ) Not   Offensive ( NO ) : if the attribute is not perceived as   offensive at all , or is positive or neutral such as   ‘ good ’ , ‘ okay ’ , etc . ; ( ii ) Slightly Offensive ( O1 ) ;   ( iii ) Somewhat Offensive ( O2 ) ; ( iv ) Moderately   Offensive ( O3 ) ; ( v ) Extremely Offensive ( O4 ) : if   the attribute is perceived as extremely offensive   when associated with the identity ( like female ,   Russian , Asian , Jew , etc . ) of a person such as   attributes implying criminal behavior and activities ,   such as ‘ criminal ’ , ‘ terrorist ’ , etc . ; ( vi ) Unsure   ( with justiﬁcation ) ( U ) : if the annotator is not sure   about if the attribute is offensive .   A.9.2 Annotator Diversity   We recruited annotators located in India , proﬁcient   in English for the annotation task . Each tuple was   seen by 3 annotators .   A.9.3 Cost of Annotation   Annotators were professional data labelers work-   ing as contractors for our vendor and were com-   pensated at rates above the prevalent market rates ,   and respecting the local regulations regarding mini-   mum wage in their respective countries . Our hourly   payout to the vendors was USD 8.22 in India .   A.9.4 Offensiveness of Stereotypes   Figure 11 demonstrates the offensiveness of stereo-   types for different regions for a stereotype thresh-   old ofθ= 2 . Figure 10 presents the distribution of   offensiveness of stereotypes on a Likert scale . 2995   stereotypes were annotated as Not Offensive and   had a mean offensiveness score of -1 , 245 stereo-   types had a mean offensiveness score of 2.6 , and   108 stereotypes were annotated as Extremely Of-   fensive with a mean offensiveness score of +4.986698679868ACL 2023 Responsible NLP Checklist   A For every submission :   /squareA1 .
