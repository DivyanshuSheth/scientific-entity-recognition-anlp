A belief state , one of the core pieces   of information , refers to the subject and its   specific content , and appears in the form of   domain - slot - value . The trained model   predicts “ accumulated ” belief states in every   turn , and joint goal accuracy and slot accu-   racy are mainly used to evaluate the predic-   tion ; however , we specify that the current eval-   uation metrics have a critical limitation when   evaluating belief states accumulated as the di-   alogue proceeds , especially in the most used   MultiWOZ dataset . Additionally , we propose   relative slot accuracy to complement existing   metrics . Relative slot accuracy does not depend   on the number of predefined slots , and allows   intuitive evaluation by assigning relative scores   according to the turn of each dialogue . This   study also encourages not solely the reporting   of joint goal accuracy , but also various comple-   mentary metrics in DST tasks for the sake of a   realistic evaluation .   1 Introduction   The dialogue state tracking ( DST ) module struc-   tures the belief state that appears during the conver-   sation in the form of domain - slot - value , to   provide an appropriate response to the user . Re-   cently , multi - turn DST datasets have been con-   structed using the Wizard - of - Oz method to reflect   more realistic dialogue situations ( Wen et al . , 2017 ;   Mrkši ´ c et al . , 2017 ; Budzianowski et al . , 2018 ) .   The characteristic of these datasets is that belief   states are “ accumulated ” and recorded every turn .   That is , the belief states of the previous turns are   included in the current turn . It confirms whether   the DST model tracks essential information that   has appeared up to the present point .   Joint goal accuracy and slot accuracy are utilized   in most cases to evaluate the prediction of accumu - lated belief states . Joint goal accuracy strictly de-   termines whether every predicted state is identical   to the gold state , whereas slot accuracy measures   the ratio of correct predictions . However , we de-   termined that these two metrics solely focus on   “ penalizing states that fail to predict , ” not consider-   ing “ reward for well - predicted states . ” Accordingly ,   as also pointed out in Rastogi et al . ( 2020a ) , joint   goal accuracy underestimates the model prediction   because of its error accumulation attribute , while   slot accuracy overestimates it because of its depen-   dency on predefined slots .   However , there is a lack of discussion on the met-   ric for evaluating the most used MultiWOZ dataset ,   despite a recently published dataset ( Rastogi et al . ,   2020b ) proposing some metrics . To address the   above challenge , we propose reporting the relative   slot accuracy along with the existing metrics in   MultiWOZ dataset . While slot accuracy has the   challenge of overestimation by always considering   all predefined slots in every turn , relative slot ac-   curacy does not depend on predefined slots , and   calculates a score that is affected solely by slots   that appear in the current dialogue . Therefore , rel-   ative slot accuracy enables a realistic evaluation   by rewarding the model ’s correct predictions , a   complementary approach that joint goal and slot   accuracies can not fully cover . It is expected that the   proposed metric can be adopted to evaluate model   performance more intuitively .   2 Current Evaluation Metrics   2.1 Joint Goal Accuracy   Joint goal accuracy , developed from Henderson   et al . ( 2014b ) and Zhong et al . ( 2018 ) , can be said   to be an ideal metric , in that it verifies that the pre-   dicted belief states perfectly match the gold label .   Equation 1 expresses how to calculate the joint   goal accuracy , depending on whether the slot val-   ues match each turn.297   JGA =   1if predicted state = gold state   0otherwise   ( 1 )   However , the joint goal accuracy underestimates   the accumulated states because it scores the per-   formances of later turn to zero if the model mis-   predicts even once in a particular turn , regardless   of the model prediction quality at later turns . As   illustrated in Figure 1 , we measured the relative   position of the turn causing this phenomenon for   the dialogue . We used MultiWOZ 2.1 ( Eric et al . ,   2019 ) , and analyzed 642 samples from a total of   999 test sets in which the joint goal accuracy of   the last turn is zero . The DST model selected for   primary verification is the SOM - DST ( Kim et al . ,   2020 ) , which is one of the latest DST models . Ac-   cordingly , the relative position where joint goal   accuracy first became zero was mainly at the be-   ginning of the dialogue . This means that the joint   goal accuracy after the beginning of the dialogue   is unconditionally measured as zero because of the   initial misprediction , although the model may cor-   rectly predict new belief states at later turns . Failure   to measure the performance of the latter part means   that it can not consider various dialogue situations   provided in the dataset , which is a critical issue in   building a realistic DST model .   2.2 Slot Accuracy   Slot accuracy can compensate for situations where   joint goal accuracy does not fully evaluate the dia-   logue situation . Equation 2 expresses how to calcu-   late the slot accuracy . Tindicates the total number   of predefined slots for all the domains . Mdenotes   the number of missed slots that the model does not   accurately predict among the slots included in the   gold state , and Wdenotes the number of wrongly   predicted slots among the slots that do not exist in   the gold state .   SA = T−M−W   T(2 )   Figure 2 illustrates the total number of annotated   slots in MultiWOZ 2.1 to figure out the limitation   of slot accuracy . Each value of x - axis in Figure 2 in-   dicates the “ maximum ” number of slots that appear   in a single dialogue , and we confirmed that approx-   imately 85 % of the test set utilized solely less than   12 of the 30 predefined slots in the experiment . Be-   cause the number of belief states appearing in the   early and middle turns of the dialogue are smaller ,   and even fewer states make false predictions , cal-   culating slot accuracy using Equation 2 reduces   the influence of MandW , and the final score is   dominated by the total slot number T. Accordingly ,   several previous studies still report the model per-   formance using solely joint goal accuracy because   slot accuracy excessively depends on the number of   predefined slots , making the performance deviation   among models trivial ( refer to Table A5 ) .   Furthermore , according to Table A6 , we deter-   mined that slot accuracy tends to be too high . The   slot accuracies of turns 0 and 1 show approxi-   mately 96 % accuracy , despite the model not cor-298Type ModelJoint Slot F1 Relative   Goal Acc . Acc . Score Slot Acc .

It becomes difficult   to compare various models in detail , if each model   shows a high performance , even though nothing   is adequately predicted . In addition , as the turn   progresses , there are no rewards for a situation in   which the model tracks the belief state without any   challenges . The case correctly predicting two out   of three in turn 4 , and the case correctly predicting   three out of four in turn 5 exhibit the same slot   accuracy . Therefore , the slot accuracy measured   according to Equation 2 differs from our intuition .   2.3 Other Metric   Recently , Rastogi et al . ( 2020b ) proposed a met-   ric called average goal accuracy . The main differ-   ence between the average goal accuracy and the   proposed relative slot accuracy is that the aver-   age goal accuracy only considers the slots with   non - empty values in the gold states of each turn ,   whereas the proposed relative slot accuracy consid-   ers those in both gold and predicted states . Since   average goal accuracy ignores the predicted states ,   it can not properly distinguish a better model from   a worse model in some specific situations . We will   discuss it in more detail in Section 4.1 .   3 Relative Slot Accuracy   As can be observed in Equation 2 , slot accuracy has   the characteristic that the larger the number of pre-   defined slots ( T ) , the smaller the deviation between   the prediction results . The deviation among DST   models will be even more minor when constructing   datasets with various dialogue situations , because   the number of predefined slots will continually in - crease . It is not presumed to be an appropriate met-   ric in terms of scalability .   Therefore , we propose relative slot accuracy , that   is not affected by predefined slots , and is evaluated   with adequate rewards and penalties that fit human   intuition in every turn . Equation 3 expresses how   to calculate the relative slot accuracy , and Tde-   notes the number of unique slots appearing in the   predicted and gold states in a particular turn .   RSA = T−M−W   T , where 0ifT= 0 ( 3 )   Relative slot accuracy rewards well - predicted be-   lief states by measuring the scores in accumulating   turns . Further discussions on the relative score will   be discussed in Section 4.1 .   4 Experiments   We measured MultiWOZ 2.1 , an improved ver-   sion of MultiWOZ 2.0 ( Budzianowski et al . , 2018 ) ,   which has been adopted in several studies , accord-   ing to Table A5 . Five domains ( i.e. , hotel , train ,   restaurant , attraction , andtaxi ) are adopted in the   experiment , following Wu et al . ( 2019 ) , and there   are a total of 30 domain - slot pairs . We selected   the DST models in Table A5 that perform the Mul-   tiWOZ experiment with the original authors ’ re-   producible code . Additionally , we reported the F1   score , which can be calculated using the current   predicted and gold states.299   4.1 Results and Discussion   Table 1 presents the overall results . Regarding slot   accuracy , the difference between the largest and   smallest values is solely 1.09 % . It can be one of   the reasons that several researchers do not report   it . Meanwhile , relative slot accuracy can explicitly   highlight the deviation among models by showing a   5.47 % difference between the largest and smallest   values . Furthermore , the correlation with joint goal   accuracy , a mainly adopted metric , and relative slot   accuracy with respect to each turn is lower than   the correlation with joint goal accuracy and slot   accuracy , as illustrated in Figure 3 . Specifically , it   can be compared with a different perspective when   using the proposed reward - considering evaluation   metric .   Domain - specific Evaluation We reported the   joint goal , slot , and relative slot accuracies per   domain utilizing the SOM - DST model in Table   2 . Relative slot accuracy derives a specific score   in the turn configuration and prediction ratio of   each domain by excluding slots that do not appear   in the conversation . For example , the taxidomain   shows a low score , meaning that it has relatively   several cases of incorrect predictions , compared   to the number of times slots belonging to the taxi   domain appear . Because slot accuracy can not distin-   guish the above trend , the score of the hotel domain   is lower than that of the taxidomain . In summary ,   relative slot accuracy enables relative comparison   according to the distribution of the domain in a   dialogue . DomainJoint Slot Relative   Goal Acc . Acc .

For example , when eval-   uating a dialogue sample that solely deals with the   restaurant domain , even domains that never ap-   pear at all ( i.e. , hotel , train , attraction , andtaxi )   are involved in measuring performance , making de-   viations among different models trivial . However ,   relative slot accuracy can evaluate the model ’s pre-   dictive score without being affected by slots never   seen in the current dialogue , which is a more realis-   tic way , considering that each dialogue contains its   own turn and slot composition . Figure 4 illustrates   the mean and standard deviations of the model per-   formance in Table 1 . As can be observed from the   results , the relative slot accuracy has a higher de-   viation than the slot accuracy , enabling a detailed   comparison among the methodologies .   Reward on Relative Dialogue Turn Relative   slot accuracy is able to reward the model ’s correct   prediction by measuring the accuracy on a relative   basis for each turn . Table A6 compares the slot and   relative slot accuracies . The relative slot accuracy   from turns 0 – 3 is measured as 0 because it cal-300Type Belief StateJoint Average Relative   Goal Acc .

In addition ,   regarding slot accuracy in turns 4 , 5 , and 6 , there   is no score improvement for the additional well-   predicted state by the model , whereas the score   increases when the newly added state is matched   in the case of relative slot accuracy . Therefore , rel-   ative slot accuracy can provide an intuitive evalu-   ation reflecting the current belief state recording   method , in which the number of slots accumulates   incrementally as the conversation progresses .   Comparison to Average Goal Accuracy Rel-   ative slot accuracy can compare DST model per-   formances more properly than average goal accu-   racy , as mentioned in Section 2.3 . Table 3 describes   how these two metrics result in different values for   the same model predictions . In this example , aver-   age goal accuracy can not consider additional belief   states incorrectly predicted by Model B , result-   ing in the same score between the two models . In   contrast , relative slot accuracy can give a penalty   proportional to the number of wrong predictions   because it includes both gold and predicted states   when calculating the score . Consequently , relative   slot accuracy has a more elaborated discriminative   power than the average goal accuracy .   5 Conclusion   This paper points out the challenge that the existing   joint goal and slot accuracies can not fully evaluate   the accumulating belief state of each turn in the   MultiWOZ dataset . Accordingly , the relative slot   accuracy is proposed . This metric is not affected   by unseen slots in the current dialogue situation ,   and compensates for the model ’s correct predic - tion . When the DST task is scaled up to deal with   more diverse conversational situations , a realistic   model evaluation will be possible using relative slot   accuracy . Moreover , we suggest reporting various   evaluation metrics to complement the limitations of   each metric in future studies , not solely reporting   the joint goal accuracy .

In this section , we discuss a few cases of   59 dialogues that do not show the trend among 642   dialogues selected in Section 2.1 ; however , it is im-   portant to note that these few cases have negligible   effect on the trend in Figure 1 , solely changing the   position where the joint goal accuracy first becomes   zero .   We sampled dialogues of the MultiWOZ 2.1 test   set in Table A1 and Table A2 , and marked values   appearing in the dialogue in bold . Table A3 and   Table A4 indicate the corresponding belief states of   each dialogue . In the first dialogue presented in Ta-   ble A1 , the joint goal accuracy is measured as 1 at   turn 2 . In this case , the model incorrectly predicted   therestaurant - pricerange slot at turns 0   and 1 , and then the utterance about the slot ap-   peared by chance . In a general case , the wrong pre-   diction of the restaurant - pricerange slot   at turn 0 will accumulate to the last turn . However ,   in this case , another incorrect prediction at turn 3   will cause error accumulation in this dialogue .   The second dialogue presented in Table A2 ,   reports the incorrect prediction according to   the interpretation of annotations at turn 4 . In   other words , because the dialogue about the   hotel - internet slot appears over turns 4 and   5 , it is solely an error depending on the predic-   tion timing of the model . Because the correct   belief state was predicted right from turn 5 , it   can not be said to be an error accumulation phe-   nomenon ; however , the model did not predict the   hotel - pricerange slot at turn 6 , which is the   last turn in this case .   In conclusion , it can be determined that the   model does not seem to accumulate erroneous pre-   dictions because of an accidental situation or inter-   pretation of annotations , but this does not negate   the error accumulation phenomenon . Furthermore ,   the fact that the starting point of making the joint   goal accuracy of subsequent turns to 0 mainly oc-   curs at the beginning of the dialogue does not   change.303Turn Dialogue History   0System : “ ”   User : “ can you help me find a nice restaurant ? ”   1System : “ sure ! what kind of food do you like ? ”   User : “ i was thinking some indian food would be great . ”   2System : “ i have 22 indian restaurant -s do you have a preference for area of town ? ”   User : “ no , i do not care where it is . i am thinking i would like an expensive restaurant . ”   3System : “ would you like to try curry garden ? ”   User : “ that is fine book me a table for 6onsatat17:30 . i also need a train for the same and   should leave leicester forcambridge ”   4System : “ alright , i have made your requested booking at curry garden , and the reference   number is hk9ycl6z . as for the train , what time would you like to depart ? ”   User : “ it does not matter as long as i am there by 13:45 leaving leicester going to cambridge ,   i ’ll need the reference number too please ”   5System : “ i have found tr6210 leaving leicester at 11:09 on saturday and arriving in cambridge   at 12:54 . i have booked 6 seats . reference number is lr5i1rzv . anything else i can do ? ”   User : “ that will be all for today . thanks so much for all your help . goodbye ”   Turn Dialogue History   0System : “ ”   User : “ i would like help finding a train headed to cambridge . ”   1System : “ i will be happy to help you find a train . can you tell me where you will be departing   from ? ”   User : “ departing from london kings cross ontuesday . ”   2System : “ when would you like to leave or arrive by ? ”   User : “ i need to arrive by 18,30 . ”   3System : “ take train tr1434 , which will arrive at 18:08 . shall i book you for that train ? ”   User : “ can i get the price for a ticket , first ? ”   4System : “ sure ! the ticket is 23.60 pounds . ”   User : “ thanks ! i am also looking for a hotel called archway house . can you tell me if they   have free wifi ? ”   5System : “ they do . would you like to book a room ? ”   User : “ i would first like to know what their price range and hotel type are , thank you . ”   6System : “ archway house is a moderate -ly priced guesthouse . would you like their address or   perhaps to book a room there ? ”   User : “ thank you , but no . you ’ve already helped me with everything i needed today .”304Turn Predicted State Gold State Joint Goal Acc .   0 restaurant -
