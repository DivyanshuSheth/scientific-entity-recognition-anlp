Most tasks benefit   mainly from high quality paraphrases , namely   those that are semantically similar to , yet lin-   guistically diverse from , the original sentence .   Generating high - quality paraphrases is chal-   lenging as it becomes increasingly hard to pre-   serve meaning as linguistic diversity increases .   Recent works achieve nice results by control-   ling specific aspects of the paraphrase , such   as its syntactic tree . However , they do not al-   low to directly control the quality of the gener-   ated paraphrase , and suffer from low flexibil-   ity and scalability . Here we propose QCPG ,   a quality - guided controlled paraphrase gener-   ation model , that allows directly controlling   the quality dimensions . Furthermore , we sug-   gest a method that given a sentence , identi-   fies points in the quality control space that   are expected to yield optimal generated para-   phrases . We show that our method is able   to generate paraphrases which maintain the   original meaning while achieving higher di-   versity than the uncontrolled baseline . The   models , the code , and the data can be found   in .   1 Introduction   Paraphrase generation , namely rewriting a sentence   using different words and/or syntax while preserv-   ing its meaning ( Bhagat and Hovy , 2013 ) , is an   important technique in natural language processing ,   that has been widely used in various downstream   tasks including question answering ( Fader et al . ,   2014a ; McCann et al . , 2018 ) , summarization ( Rush   et al . , 2015 ) , data augmentation ( Yu et al . , 2018 )   and adversarial learning ( Iyyer et al . , 2018 ) . How-   ever , not all paraphrases are equally useful . For   most real - world applications , paraphrases which   are too similar to the original sentence are of lim-   ited value , while those with high linguistic diversity , Figure 1 : Density of paraphrases in WikiAnswers as   a function of the semantic similarity and the linguistic   diversity . The marked area , which contains high quality   paraphrases , is very sparse ( The measures used in the   figure are described in Section 2.1 ) .   i.e. with large syntactic / lexical differences between   the paraphrase and the original sentence , are more   beneficial to the robustness and accuracy of auto-   matic text evaluation and classification , and can   avoid the blandness caused by repetitive patterns   ( Qian et al . , 2019 ) . The quality of paraphrases is   often evaluated using three dimensions , where high   quality paraphrases are those with high semantic   similarity as well as high lexical and/or syntactic   diversity ( McCarthy et al . , 2009 ) .   Generating high quality paraphrases can be chal-   lenging ( for both humans and automatic models )   since it is increasingly difficult to preserve meaning   with increasing linguistic diversity . Indeed , when   examining the quality of paraphrases among para-   phrase generation datasets , one can find a wide   range of paraphrase qualities , where the area of   high quality is often very sparse ( see Figure 1 ) .   This in turn results in scarcity of supervised data   for high - quality paraphrase generation.596A recent approach aiming to produce high qual-   ity paraphrases is controlled paraphrase generation ,   which exposes control mechanisms that can be ma-   nipulated to produce diversity . While the controlled   generation approaches have yielded impressive re-   sults , they require providing the model with very   specific information regarding the target sentence ,   such as its parse tree ( Iyyer et al . , 2018 ) or the list   of keywords it needs to contain ( Zeng et al . , 2019 ) .   However , for most downstream applications , the   important property of the paraphrase is its overall   quality , rather than its specific syntactic or lexi-   cal form . The over - specificity of existing control-   based methods not only complicates their usage   and limits their scalability , but also hinders their   coverage . Thus , it would be desirable to develop   a paraphrase generation model , which uses a sim-   ple mechanism for directly controlling paraphrase   quality , while avoiding unnecessary complications   associated with fine - grained controls .   In this paper we propose QCPG , a Quality Con-   trolled Paraphrase Generation model , that given   an input sentence and quality constraints , repre-   sented by a three dimensional vector of semantic   similarity , and syntactic and lexical distances , pro-   duces a target sentence that conforms to the quality   constraints .   Our constraints are much simpler than previously   suggested ones , such as parse trees or keyword lists ,   and leave the model the freedom to choose how to   attain the desired quality levels .   Enabling the direct control of the three quality   dimensions , allows flexibility with respect to the   specific requirements of the task at hand , and opens   a range of generation possibilities : paraphrases of   various flavors ( e.g. syntactically vs. lexically di-   verse ) , quasi - paraphrases ( with lower semantic sim-   ilarity ) , and even non - paraphrases which may be   useful for downstream tasks ( e.g. hard negative   examples of sentences that are linguistically simi-   lar but have different meanings ( Guo et al . , 2018 ;   Reimers and Gurevych , 2020 ) ) .   Our results show that the QCPG model indeed   enables controlling paraphrase quality along the   three quality dimensions .   Furthermore , even though the training data is   of mixed quality , and exhibits scarcity in the high   quality area ( see Figure 1 ) , our model is able to   learn high quality paraphrasing behavior , i.e. it   increases the linguistic diversity of the generated   paraphrases without decreasing the semantic simi - larity compared to the uncontrolled baseline .   2 Method   In this section we provide a general description   of our approach . We first explain how the differ-   ent quality dimensions are measured . We then de-   scribe the controlled paraphrase generation model ,   QCPG , and finally we suggest a method that given   the task requirements , detects the input control val-   ues which maximize the quality of the generated   paraphrases . Figure 2 summarizes our proposed so-   lution for generating controlled paraphrases , which   is detailed in the rest of the section .   2.1 Quantifying Paraphrase Quality   The most common dimensions for measuring   paraphrase quality are the semantic , syntactic   and lexical dimensions . Several previous works   used also a fluency evaluation metric ( Siddique   et al . , 2020 ) . However , since our focus is on   the supervised setting , we rely on the gold para-   phrases as fluency guidance for the model ( Mc-   Carthy et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , given a sentence s   and a paraphrase s , we define the paraphrase   quality as a three dimensional vector q(s , s ) =   ( q(s , s ) , q(s , s ) , q(s , s ) ) , where qis   a measure of semantic similarity , and qandq   are measures of syntactic and lexical variation , re-   spectively . For the syntactic score , inspired by   Iyyer et al . ( 2018 ) we choose q(s , s)to be the   normalized tree edit distance ( Zhang and Shasha ,   1989 ) between the third level constituency parse-   trees of sands , after removing the tokens - to   increase the decoupling from the lexical distance   metric . We define the lexical score q(s , s)to   be the normalized character - level minimal edit dis-   tance between the bag of words . This measure is   independent of word order , and hence increases the   decoupling from syntactic measures . Additionally ,   calculating the token distances on the character   level enables to capture tokens that share the same   stem / lemma . Character - level distance is also more   robust to typos that may be found in noisy data .   As for the semantic score , several strong metrics   have been recently proposed for measuring seman-   tic similarity between sentences . In order to se-   lectq(s , s ) , we studied the agreement between   the candidate metrics and human judgments , using   only development data , and found Bleurt ( Sellam   et al . , 2020 ) to have the highest correlation with hu-   man judgments ( see Appendix A ) . Thus , we define597   q(s , s)to be the Bleurt score , normalized using   the sigmoid function to ensure a uniform range of   values , [ 0,1 ] , for all three quality dimensions . For   ease of presentation all metrics are presented on a   0âˆ’100scale .   2.2 The QCPG Model   The main component of our solution is a quality   controlled paraphrase generation model ( QCPG ) ,   which is an encoder - decoder model trained on the   task of controlled paraphrase generation . Given   an input sentence sand a control vector c=   ( c , c , c ) , the goal of QCPG is to generate   an output paraphrase QCPG ( s , c)that conforms   toc . We train QCPG using the training set pairs   ( s , t ) , by setting cto be q(s , t ) , and maximizing   P(t|s , c = q(s , t))over the training set via the   autoregressive cross entropy loss .   2.3 Control Values Selection   A major challenge in the research of controlled   paraphrase generation , is selecting appropriate in-   put control values that can be achieved by the   model ( Goyal and Durrett , 2020 ) . Clearly , given a   sentence , not all paraphrase qualities are achievable .   Some sentences are more amenable to paraphrasing   than others . For example , named entities and num-   bers are much harder to be replaced while keeping   sentence meaning , and hence , the potential lexical   diversity of paraphrases involving such terms is   relatively limited . Forcing QCPG to conform to   quality control values that are too high with respect   to the input sentence , may lead to suboptimal qual-   ity of the resultant paraphrases . Thus , for a moreeffective use of QCPG , the control values should   be determined with respect to the input sentence .   Below we describe the second part of our so-   lution , namely a method that given a sentence ,   predicts the input control values , c(s ) , that opti-   mize the expected quality of the paraphrases gen-   erated by QCPG . For simplicity we assume that   the quality distribution p(q|s)of all paraphrases   of sentence s , is approximately normally dis-   tributed around a sentence dependent mean q(s ) ,   and that the variance is approximately sentence-   independent . We further assume that given an input   sentence s , the difficulty to generate a paraphrase   of a given quality , q , is dominated by p(q|s)rather   than by the quality vector qitself .   Following our assumptions , the level of dif-   ficulty can be expressed by the offset , o=   ( o , o , o)ofqfromq(s ) . Thus , the in-   put control , c(s ) , for QCPG , is the sum of q(s )   and an offset o.   Our aim is to analyze the model results for vary-   ing levels of difficulty , namely under different off-   sets , o , from q(s ) .   The Quality Predictor ( QP):Since q(s)is   unknown , we introduce QP , a regressor whose   output , termed the reference of s , r(s ) =   ( r(s ) , r(s ) , r(s ) ) , approximates q(s ) .   During training , QPaims to predict q(s , t)given   s , where ( s , t)are the input - output pairs of the   training data .   To summarize , we define sentence - aware quality   control by decomposing the QCPG input control ,   c , into a sum of a sentence dependent reference598point , r(s ) , and a sentence independent offset , o.   3 Data and Implementation Details   3.1 Datasets   To test the ability of our model to learn high quality   behavior from mixed quality data we use weakly   annotated datasets . These datasets are large but   noisy , and contain only a relatively small amount   of high quality paraphrases .   MSCOCO : This dataset consists of 123 K im-   ages , where each image contains at most five   human - labeled captions ( Lin et al . , 2014 ) . Similar   to previous works we consider different captions   of the same image as paraphrases .   WikiAnswers ( WikiAns for short ) : The   WikiAnswers corpus contains clusters of ques-   tions tagged by wiki-answers.com users as similar .   There are 30,370,994clusters with 25question in   each on average . In total , the corpus contains over   70million question pairs ( Fader et al . , 2014b ) .   ParaBank2.0 : A dataset containing clusters of   sentential paraphrases , produced from a bilingual   corpus using negative constraints , inference sam-   pling , and clustering ( Hu et al . , 2019 ) . The dataset   is composed of avarage of 5paraphrases in every   cluster and close to 100million pairs in total .   To get comparable results across all datasets , we   randomly sub - sampled ParaBank2.0 and WikiAns   to the same size as MSCOCO , and split them to   train , dev and test sets , of sizes 900K,14Kand   14Krespectively . We carefully made sure that   there are no pairs from the same cluster in differ-   ent splits of the data . The full data splits will be   published with our code .   3.2 Implementation Details   All models are trained with batch size of 32on2   NVIDIA A100 GPUs for 6epochs . Full details   as well as train and dev results can be found in   Appendix C.1 .   QCPG : We use the pre - trained T5 - base ( Raffel   et al . , 2020 ) as the encoder - decoder model . The   control input vector to QCPG is quantized at every   dimension into 20equally spaced values ranging   from 0to100 . Each value is assigned to a special   saved - token . The three tokens corresponding to   the quantized values of the control vector c , are   concatenated to the head of the input sentence , and   together used as input to the model . r(s)andoare   also quantized in a similar way . QP : An Electra base model ( Clark et al . , 2020 )   finetuned with MSE loss to predict the typical qual-   ity values ( see Section 2.3 ) .   Baseline Model ( BL ): A T5 - base model fine-   tuned on the training data .   For all the models , we adopt the experimental   setup used in ( Devlin et al . , 2019 ) , i.e. we train the   model with several learning rates and choose the   one that achieves the highest dev set performance   ( see appendix C.1 ) .   4 Results   4.1 Controlling the Quality Dimensions   The aim of the following analysis is to study the   level of control achieved by QCPG . To this end ,   we measure the model response to changes in the   input offsets . We compute the expected difference   in paraphrase quality , as a result of applying an   input offset ocompared to zero offset as a refer-   ence . More formally , we define the 3 - dimensional   responsiveness vector of QCPG at an offset o ,   R(o)asQ(o)âˆ’Q((0,0,0 ) ) , where Q(o)is the   expected quality of the paraphrases generated by   QCPG at an offset o. We estimate Q(o)by aver-   aging q(QCPG ( s , r(s ) + o))over the input sen-   tences sof the dev set , and denote this estimate by   ËœQ(o ) = ( ËœQ(o),ËœQ(o),ËœQ(o ) ) , and the   corresponding estimate of R(o)byËœR(o ) .   Specifically , in the following analysis we are in-   terested in studying the model response to each   of the dimensions separately , i.e. how changing   the input offset along a given quality dimension   dim â€“ the controlled dimension â€“ while keeping   the two other dimensions constant , affects the re-   sponsiveness in each of the three dimensions . A   good control mechanism would imply that increas-   ing the input offset in one dimension will result in   a monotonically increasing responsiveness in that   dimension , with relatively small responsiveness in   the other two dimensions .   Figure 3 shows , for each of the three datasets ,   the responsiveness in the three quality dimensions ,   when changing the input offset along each of the   three dimensions , while fixing the input offsets in   the other two dimensions at 0 . Examining the ac-   tual values of quality in the paraphrases of the dev   sets , reveals that the standard deviation is different   in each dimension . Hence , for clarity of presen-   tation , we present the input offset values and the   responsiveness in units of standard deviation as   measured in the respective dimension and dev set.599For the range of offsets displayed in Figure 3 ,   the responsiveness in the controlled dimension in-   creases monotonically with the input offsets across   all datasets and dimensions . As expected , the re-   sponsiveness in the uncontrolled dimensions does   not zeros due to the inherent coupling between   the dimensions . For example , many changes that   increase syntactic diversity , also increase lexical   diversity ( e.g. a move from passive to active voice ) .   Still , our control mechanism is able to increase the   responsiveness in the controlled dimension with   relative low responsiveness in the uncontrolled di-   mensions . Specifically , focusing on the relation   between semantic similarity and expression diver-   sity , the figure shows that there is a minor decrease   in semantic similarity in response to an increase   in lexical and syntactic diversity . In the next sec-   tion , we will show that this does not prevent our   model from generating paraphrases that are not   only more lexically and syntactically diverse , but   also more semantically similar to the source sen-   tences , compared to the paraphrases generated by   the uncontrolled baseline .   Figure 3 focused on small to moderate input off-   sets , i.e. offsets up to 2stds from the reference   point . However , as we speculated before , with in-   creasing offsets , i.e. the more the requested control   value deviates from the typical value , it becomes   increasingly difficult to generate a paraphrase that   conforms to the requested control value . Figure 4   depicts the responsiveness in the syntactic and lexi-   cal dimensions for a larger range of offset values .   For the semantic dimension , the typical values are   too high to allow large positive offsets , which for   most sentences result in exceeding the upper limit   of the semantic score . Indeed , as can be seen in   Figure 4 , when moving to high offset values , the   responsiveness in the syntactic and lexical dimen-   sions starts to decrease . This behavior is in line   with our aforementioned hypothesis , and reflects   the detrimental effect of feeding QCPG with in-   put control values that are too far from the typical   paraphrase qualities of the input sentence . The non-   monotonic behavior of the responsiveness implies   that the input offsets should be selected carefully in   order to optimize the quality of the resultant para-   phrases . In Section 4.2 we suggest a method for   identifying these optimal offsets.4.2 Selecting Optimal Input Control Values   In this section , we suggest a method that given task   requirements , selects the input offsets that are ex-   pected to yield the desired quality of paraphrases .   The idea is to compute the estimated expected qual-   ity,ËœQ(o ) , for each input offset o , using the dev   set as described in Section 4.1 , and then search   the 3D grid of input offsets to find the point for   which ËœQ(o)is best suited for the user â€™s require-   ments . We envision this analysis as a preliminary   step in which the user chooses the input control pa-   rameters that best achieve his desired paraphrasing   operation point , and then uses the chosen values at   inference â€“ which is why we use the dev set .   We study the behavior of ËœQ(o)as a function of   the 3D grid of offset points in the relevant range , i.e   every owhere o , oandoin0,5,10 ... 50 .   Figure 5 depicts ËœQ(o)for WikiAns , on a slice of   the full offset grid . The results for the full grid   on all datasets are shown in Figure 6 . The right-   hand - side map depicts the estimated linguistic di-   versity ( the average of ËœQ(o)andËœQ(o ) ) and   the left - hand - side depicts the semantic similarity ,   ËœQ(o ) ) . The maps are presented for o= 50 ,   and for different values of oando . As   expected , the two measures are anti - correlated ,   where areas with increased semantic similarity   are characterized by decreased linguistic diversity .   TheQCPG results are compared to two reference   points , which are invariant to oand are marked   on the colorbars with black squares : â€™ Dataset â€™   is the semantic - similarity / linguistic - diversity av-   erage value over the corresponding dev set para-   phrases , and â€™ Baseline â€™ is the average semantic-   similarity / linguistic - diversity of the uncontrolled   baseline over the corresponding dev set . Notice   that the average diversity level achieved by the un-   controlled baseline is lower than that of the dev   set mean , reflecting the difficulty of this model to   generate diverse paraphrases . QCPG on the other   hand , with suitable input offset values , is able to   generate paraphrases which are on average higher   than the baseline both in their linguistic diversity   and in their semantic similarity , and in fact even   higher in many cases than the values of the ground   truth paraphrases in the dev - set .   In general , the estimates of the expected qual-   ity achieved by QCPG at different input offsets ,   enable a user to generate paraphrases at different   operation points , by manipulating the input offset   control oto meet her desired quality values . Con-600601   sider for example a typical use case , of aiming to   maximize linguistic diversity under a constraint on   semantic similarity . An example of such a case   is an operation point , denoted by QCPG , which   aims to exemplify the advantage of QCPG over the   baseline , by maximizing linguistic diversity under   the constraint that the semantic similarity is at least   5points higher than the baseline . The input off-   set values to obtain this operation point depend on   the dataset , and can be found using heatmaps such   as in Figure 5 . For WikiAns the input offset for   theQCPGoperation point values are ( 50,35,5 )   ( entry marked by the black square ) .   4.3 Quality Evaluation on the Test Set   In the previous section we saw , using estimates   based on the dev sets , that there are many opera-   tion points which generate paraphrases with higher   quality than those achieved by the uncontrolled   baseline . We now turn to evaluate one such op-   eration point , namely QCPG , using the source   sentences of the testsets which were not used in   the selection of the input offset values .   Automatic Evaluation We use four quality mea-   sures to evaluate different aspects of generated para-   phrases . The three quality measures used in the   control of QCPG ( Section 2.1 ) and Self - BLEU   ( Zhu et al . , 2018 ) as adapted in Li et al . ( 2019 ) ; Liu   et al . ( 2020a ) , which aims to measure the linguistic   diversity in the generated paraphrases by penaliz-   ing copying from input sentences . As can be seen   in Table 1 , QCPGoutperforms the baseline in allmetrics across all datasets , as predicted using the   dev - set heatmaps . A clear advantage is obtained   even for Self - BLEU , which was not part of the met-   rics used as input controls . Importantly , the quality   of the paraphrases generated by our model is com-   parable to , or at times better than the quality of   the paraphrases in the ground truth of the datasets .   Examples of paraphrases generated by QCPG   compared to the ground truth paraphrases appear   in Table 10 . This is an important step towards the   goal of obtaining paraphrases in the sparse area of   high quality ( recall the top right corner of Figure   1 ) .   Additionally , we examined QCPG from another   perspective : the effect of the quality guidance on   the model â€™s ability to predict the ground truth para-   phrases . Tables 5 and 6 show the BLEU scores   ( Papineni et al . , 2002 ) obtained by QCPG and the   uncontrolled baseline respectively . The results ver-   ify that the input quality vectors induced by the   target sentences are effectively utilized by QCPG   to achieve better prediction performance .   Human Evaluation While linguistic diversity   can be automatically measured by reliable met-   rics such as Self - BLEU , measuring semantic sim-   ilarity is more challenging . We therefore rely on   automatic metrics for evaluating the lexical and   syntactic diversity , but use human annotation for   validating the semantic evaluation . To this end , we   selected a sample of 50source sentences from each   test set , and generated one paraphrase using the   uncontrolled baseline and one using QCPG . The602   annotators were shown the source sentence , along   with the two generated paraphrases ( randomly or-   dered ) , and were asked which of the two better pre-   serves the semantic meaning of the source sentence   ( ties are also allowed ) . In total , 150triplets were   evaluated by 5judges . Table 2 demonstrates an   advantage for QCPGin all datasets , with a large   margin in MSCOCO and WikiAns . This advantage   is statistically significant ( pâˆ’value < 0.05 ) as ob-   tained by applying the Wilcoxon signed - rank test   to the difference between the number of annota-   tors that voted for QCPGand those voted for the   baseline , across all datasets . Thus , the human eval-   uation is in line with the results of the automatic   semantic similarity measure . We also verified , that   the results of this sample , in terms of linguistic   diversity , are very similar to those shown in Table   1 .   For examples of paraphrases generated by   QCPGsee Table 10 in the Appendix .   5 Related Work   Many recent works on paraphrase generation have   been focused on attempting to achieve high - quality   paraphrases . These works can be divided into su-   pervised and unsupervised approaches .   Supervised Approaches To achieve diversity , some works focused on diverse decoding using   heuristics such as Hamming distance or distinct   n - grams to preserve diverse options during beam   search ( Vijayakumar et al . , 2018 ) . Other works   generate multiple outputs by perturbing latent rep-   resentations ( Gupta et al . , 2018 ; Park et al . , 2019 ) .   or by using distinct generators ( Qian et al . , 2019 ) .   These methods achieve some diversity , but do not   control generation in an interpretable manner .   The works that are most similar to ours strive   to gain diversity using controlled - paraphrase gen-   eration , by exposing control mechanisms that are   manipulated to produce either lexically ( Zeng et al . ,   2019 ; Thompson and Post , 2020 ) or syntactically   ( Chen et al . , 2019 ; Goyal and Durrett , 2020 ) di-   verse paraphrases . One approach is to use an ex-   emplar sentence for guiding the syntax of the gen-   erated paraphrase ( Chen et al . , 2019 ; Bao et al . ,   2019 ; Hosking and Lapata , 2021 ) . An alternative is   to directly employ constituency tree as the syntax   guidance ( Iyyer et al . , 2018 ; Li and Choi , 2020 ) .   Goyal and Durrett ( 2020 ) promote syntactic diver-   sity by conditioning over possible syntactic rear-   rangements of the input . Zeng et al . ( 2019 ) use   keywords as lexical guidance for the generation   process . Here we introduce a simple model for   jointly controlling the lexical , syntactic and seman-   tic aspects of the generated paraphrases .   Unsupervised Approaches Niu et al . ( 2020 )   rely on neural models to generate high quality para-   phrases , using a decoding method that enforces   diversity by preventing repetitive copying of the   input tokens . Liu et al . ( 2020b ) optimize a quality   oriented objective by casting paraphrase generation   as an optimization problem , and searching the sen-   tence space to find the optimal point . Garg et al .   ( 2021 ) and Siddique et al . ( 2020 ) use reinforcement   learning with quality - oriented reward combining   textual entailment , semantic similarity , expression603diversity and fluency . In this work , we employ   similar metrics for guiding the generation of para-   phrases within the supervised framework .   6 Discussion   In this paper , we propose a novel controlled para-   phrase generation model , that leverages measures   of paraphrase quality for encouraging the genera-   tion of paraphrases with desired quality . We demon-   strate the high level of control achieved by the   model , and suggest a method for coping with the   challenging problem of finding suitable control val-   ues .   Aside from offering a simple and effective way   for controlling models â€™ output quality , the qual-   ity control paradigm enables a holistic view of the   data , the training process and the final model anal-   ysis . Namely : ( I ) Examination of the training data   through the lens of data quality enables to charac-   terize the data at hand , its strengths and limitations .   ( II ) A quality - aware training process can be viewed   as multi - task learning , where each quality level is a   separate task with its own accurate supervision , as   opposed to the standard quality - agnostic approach ,   where low quality data is in fact used as a poor   supervision for a model which aims at generating   higher quality output . ( III ) Analyzing the model be-   havior under different quality controls , allows finer   understanding of the different model behaviors and   the trade - offs between their output qualities . Better   understanding the expected output quality of neural   NLG models , for different input quality controls ,   can increase the trust in their output .   Finally , our model analysis consistently shows   that although the models generally follow the qual-   ity requirements , there is still room for improve-   ment . A possible direction for future research is   exploring methods , such as reinforcement learning ,   for further improving the ability of the model to   satisfy the quality requirements .   References604605   A Selecting the semantic similarity   measure   Recently , several strong metrics have been pro-   posed for measuring semantic similarity between   sentences ( Reimers and Gurevych , 2019 ; ? ; Sel-   lam et al . , 2020 ) . In order to select the semantic   similarity metric for QCPG , we performed a small   experiment over the three dev sets , with the aim of   measuring the agreement of the candidate metrics   with human judgments . To this end , we leveraged   two properties that characterize weakly labeled   datasets , the underlying clusters of sentences , and   the high variability of semantic similarity . Given   a dataset , we randomly selected 100clusters , and   picked three sentences at random from each clus-   ter . For each triplet of sentences t= ( t , t , t )   we asked 5human annotators to choose which of   the two sentences , tort , better preserves the   semantic meaning of t. In order to find the candi-   date similarity measure with the highest agreement   with human judgments , we first computed , for each   triplet , the difference between the number of anno-   tators voted for tand those voted for t. We then   computed for each candidate measure , the differ-   ence between the similarity of ttotand and of   ttot . We then measured Kendall â€™s Tau correla-   tion ( Daniel , 1990 ) between the difference vector   of the human judgments and that of the judgments   of each of the candidate measures . Table 3 shows   the resultant correlations . The highest correlations   are obtained for SBERT ( Reimers and Gurevych ,   2019 ) , but since it was trained on WikiAns and   MSCOCO , we could not use it in our study . We   selected Bleurt due to its highest correlation with   human judgments over the three datasets ( among   the methods that were not exposed to the consid-   ered datasets ) . We normalize Bleurt score using   the sigmoid function to ensure a uniform range of   values , [ 0,1 ] , for the three quality dimensions .   B Correlation of semantic similarity   measures with linguistic diversity   We study the coupling between the different seman-   tic similarity measures and the linguistic diversity .   We assume that the level of coupling of a good sim-   ilarity measure will resemble that of humans , and   will be less sensitive to lexical and syntactic proper-   ties of the paraphrase . Table 4 presents the Kendall   tau correlation between the different similarity mea-   sures and the linguistic diversity . Results for hu-   man judgments are also shown for a reference . The   correlation calculation is performed between the   vectors of differences as described in section A ) .   The results show that Bleurt demonstrates the low-   est coupling with linguistic diversity among the   automatic measures ( aside from SBERT which , as   mentioned before , was trained with MSCOCO and   WikiAns ) . The comparison to human judgments   shows that Bleurt is more influenced by linguistic   features , indicating that automatic measures need   to be further improved to reach the decoupling level   achieved by humans.606   C Models Details and Training Results   The learning rates for the QCPG and the Baseline   models were selected in the following way . For   a given dataset , we finetuned the models with 4   learning rates ( 1e-3,1e-4,5e-3,5e-4 ) ( The training   results of the baseline presented in Table 5 and the   results of QCPG presented in Table 6 . ) . For the   baseline we selected the one which yielded the   best BLEU score ( Papineni et al . , 2002 ) on the   corresponding dev set The best learning rate for   every dataset was chosen based on the Dev set   BLEU score . For the QCPG we chose the model   that best conforms to the control input as measured   by the MSE between the input control vector and   the output quality vector ( see Table 9 ) . The QP   model is an Electra - Base model finetuned with 4   different learning rates ( 1.5e-4,1e-4,3e-5,5e-5 ) .   We choose the learning rate the yields the minimal   MSE on the dev set ( For full results see Table 8)   C.1 Full Heatmaps   The full heatmaps can be found in Figure 6.607608609
