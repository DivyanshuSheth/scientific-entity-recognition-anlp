Most existing methods   generalize poorly since the learned parame-   ters are only optimal for seen classes rather   than for both classes , and the parameters keep   stationary in predicting procedures . To ad-   dress these challenges , we propose a novel   Learn to Adapt ( LTA ) network using a variant   meta - learning framework . Specifically , LTA   trains an adaptive classifier by using both seen   and virtual unseen classes to simulate a gen-   eralized zero - shot learning ( GZSL ) scenario   in accordance with the test time , and simul-   taneously learns to calibrate the class proto-   types and sample representations to make the   learned parameters adaptive to incoming un-   seen classes . We claim that the proposed model   is capable of representing all prototypes and   samples from both classes to a more consistent   distribution in a global space . Extensive exper-   iments on five text classification datasets show   that our model outperforms several competi-   tive previous approaches by large margins . The   code and the whole datasets are available at   https://github.com/Quareia/LTA .   1 Introduction   Text classification plays an important role in many   natural language processing ( NLP ) applications ,   such as question classification , news categorization ,   user intent classification and so on ( Minaee et al . ,   2021 ) . Although a wide variety of methods have   been proved successful in supervised text classifica-   tion , they often break down when applied to make   predictions for incrementally emerging classes   without labeled training data ( Pourpanah et al . ,   2020 ) . Unlike zero - shot learning ( ZSL ) that aims to   classify unseen class instances at test time ( Romera-   Paredes and Torr , 2015 ; Wang et al . , 2019 ) , gener-   alized zero - shot learning ( GZSL ) , which we focuson in this work , aims to classify text samples from   both previous seen and emerging novel classes .   Since there is a strong bias towards seen classes   ( Xian et al . , 2019a ) , GZSL is a more challenging   yet critical problem .   Previously methods mainly focus on transduc-   tive approaches for generalized zero - shot text clas-   sification . Rios and Kavuluru ( 2018 ) use a graph   convolution network to enhance the unseen class   label embeddings . Zhang et al . ( 2019 ) and Song   et al . ( 2020 ) generate illusion feature embeddings   for unseen classes based on side information , i.e. ,   class - level attributes or text description . More re-   cently , Ye et al . ( 2020 ) use reinforced self - training   methods to leverage unlabeled data during training .   With the assumption that no knowledge about   unseen categories is available during the model   learning phase , researchers resort to inductive ap-   proaches to handle generalized zero - shot text clas-   sification . ReCapsNet ( Liu et al . , 2019 ) uses a   dimensional attention - based intent capsule network   and constructs zero - shot class prototypes by simi-   larity matrix transformation . SEG ( Yan et al . , 2020 )   exploits an outlier detection approach that can be di-   rectly applied on ReCapsNet , which discriminates   the domain first , then outputs the final class label .   However , the existing methods still have two key   limitations . Firstly , while the goal of these meth-   ods is to transfer beneficial knowledge for unseen   classes , these models merely learn optimal parame-   ters by minimizing the loss of instances from seen   classes , regardless of explicitly calibrating the pre-   dictions on unseen classes . Therefore , domain bias   problem ( Xian et al . , 2019a ) towards seen classes   is not fairly resolved . Secondly , although some of   them take into account the inter - class relationship   when constructing prototypes for unseen classes   ( Liu et al . , 2019 ) , the models keep static no matter   what different new classes emerge in future appli-   cations . As a result , these models show a large   quality gap between instances from seen classes517and from emerging unseen classes .   To address these problems , motivated by the suc-   cess of meta - learning in the few - shot learning task   ( Vinyals et al . , 2016 ; Snell et al . , 2017 ; Sung et al . ,   2018 ; Finn et al . , 2017 ) , we present a novel Learn   to Adapt ( LTA ) network for generalized zero - shot   text classification . Concretely , the proposed LTA   learns over multiple learning episodes that mimic   GZSL setting explicitly during training , making   the learning setting consistent with the test environ-   ment and thereby improving generalization . The   model notably extends its ability from two views :   prototype adaptation and sample adaptation . In   each episode , the LTA adjusts the representative   prototypes of both seen classes and " fake " unseen   classes , with the assumption that unseen classes   will help in calibrating representation of seen ones   and thereby enable the model to learn the class-   sensitive representations . The updating for all pro-   totypes is then used to generate a set of calibration   parameters , called semantic components , to guide   the adaptation of sample embeddings , which is de-   signed to compensate for the shrinking features   ( Chen et al . , 2018 ) that are ignored during train-   ing if they are not discriminating for seen classes ,   but could be critical for recognizing unseen classes .   The refined sample embeddings are then classified   based on similarity scores with all adapted class   prototypes . The same setting can be directly ap-   plied in testing , where the LTA executes class pre-   diction and adapts the learned model rationally in   an on - the - fly manner .   In summary , our contributions include : ( i ) We   propose a novel Learn to Adapt ( LTA ) network for   generalized zero - shot text classification which is   capable of adapting incrementally between seen   classes and emerging unseen classes at test time .   ( ii ) We propose a methodology for calibrating both   prototypes and sample embeddings to deduce a   global representation space , efficiently avoiding   over - fitting on seen classes . ( iii ) Experimental re-   sults on five generalized zero - shot text classifica-   tion datasets show that our method outperforms   previous methods with a large margin .   2 Related Work   Generalized Zero - Shot Learning The challenge   of zero - shot learning ( ZSL ) has been the focus of   attention in recent years , especially in the applica-   tions of image classification ( Socher et al . , 2013 ;   Xian et al . , 2019a ; Wang et al . , 2019 ) , intent detec - tion ( Xia et al . , 2018 ; Liu et al . , 2019 ; Yan et al . ,   2020 ) , and question classification ( Fu et al . , 2018 ) .   Different from ZSL , generalized zero - shot learning   ( GZSL ) that attempts to categorize instances from   both seen and unseen classes is a more realistic con-   dition that matches with practical applications . For   example , a question classifier for a question answer-   ing system has to classify not only the questions   ever asked but also new questions incrementally   emerging from the users .   There are two key issues that GZSL has to ad-   dress : ( 1 ) how to incrementally learn beneficial   knowledge for unseen classes from seen ones , and   ( 2 ) how to tackle the domain bias caused by the   extremely imbalanced data of seen and unseen do-   mains .   To alleviate the first issue , some of the earliest   works on ZSL attempt to learn a matching model   between instance embedding and class prototype   embeddings represented by extra information in-   cluding class - level attribute , text description , or   their combinations ( Frome et al . , 2013 ; Nam et al . ,   2016 ; Zhu et al . , 2019 ; Xia et al . , 2018 ) . In a sim-   ilar vein , other methods ( Wang et al . , 2018 ; Rios   and Kavuluru , 2018 ; Si et al . , 2021 ) also investigate   the semantic relationship between the side informa-   tion for obtaining better prototype representation .   Nevertheless , these models are trained using data   from seen classes and fail to incrementally adapt to   emerging new classes .   The key problem of the second issue is that the   model is trained with data from the seen classes   and the parameters are actually optimized on the   seen domain , thus they are not aware of unseen   classes . Assuming the extra information about un-   seen classes is available , another prominent ap-   proach attempts to use generative models to gener-   ate virtual samples or features for unseen domains   ( Xian et al . , 2018 ; Sch√∂nfeld et al . , 2019 ; Zhang   et al . , 2019 ; Song et al . , 2020 ) . By using syn-   thesized samples , the generative approaches can   convert GZSL problem to the conventional super-   vised learning problem where biases towards seen   classes are largely alleviated . Additionally , studies   also extend to exploit the unlabeled data for unseen   classes ( Xian et al . , 2019b ; Rahman et al . , 2019 ; Ye   et al . , 2020 ) . However , these models assume that   they have access to the extra information about the   unseen classes , which is not very realistic since of-   ten neither the test data nor their label descriptions   is available at the training phase ( as supposed in518this work ) . In contrast , our model can involve all   classes ( seen and unseen ) jointly during inference ,   essentially it is trained towards continuous general-   ization for new classes , hence it is capable to adapt   to incoming new classes dynamically .   Episode - Based Training in GZSL Our ap-   proach is primarily based on the episodic training   paradigm that has been widely used in few - shot   learning ( FSL ) ( Vinyals et al . , 2016 ; Snell et al . ,   2017 ; Sung et al . , 2018 ) . The primitive goal of   episodic training is to quickly learn a meta - task   from sampled classes . A particular advantage of   episodic training is that , by constructing meta - tasks ,   the setting of training is consistent with that of test-   ing , which is essential for classification problems .   Studies extend to exploit episodic training in the   " generalized " settings . Verma et al . ( 2020 ) con-   structs model - agnostic meta - tasks to train gener-   ative models on GZSL . In addition , Gidaris and   Komodakis ( 2018 ) utilizes weight generators to up-   date unseen prototypes in generalized FSL(GFSL ) .   Subsequently , to update both seen and unseen pro-   totypes , Ye et al . ( 2021 ) exploits attention mech-   anism while Shi et al . ( 2020 ) takes advantage of   graph neural networks in GFSL . Yu et al . ( 2020 )   use a generative network to generate unseen pro-   totypes in GZSL . These methods only consider   the prototype adaptation while the sample embed-   dings are still static whatever the unseen classes   are . Additionally , Bao et al . ( 2020 ) uses distribu-   tional signatures to update sample embeddings in   GFSL . Considering that distributional signatures   can be equal for two different tasks , our method   uses a novel semantic update extractor to update   samples following the prototype adaptation rather   than statistical information .   A compelling property of our method is that it   tackles knowledge transferring and domain bias si-   multaneously in an episodic training framework by   adapting both prototypes and sample embeddings ,   and draws a fast adaptation to the novel classes   without the cost of dramatic damage in discriminat-   ing the seen classes .   3 Methodology   3.1 Problem Definition   Formally , let Y={y , ... , y}andY=   { y , ... , y}denote Cseen classes and Cun-   seen classes respectively , and Y = Y‚à™ Yde-   note the global label space with Y‚à© Y=‚àÖ.Suppose we have a collection of training samples   D={(x , y , a ) } , that consists of Msam-   ples from Cseen classes , where x‚àà Xrepre-   sents j - th text utterance , yandaare its one - hot   class label and corresponding class - level textual   description , respectively . At the test time , provided   with a class description set A={a}for un-   seen classes , the GZSL task is to classify the test   instance into either a seen or an unseen class .   3.2 Overview   Encoder An textual input xwithTwords is en-   coded by a BERT ( Devlin et al . , 2019 ) ( or any other   textual encoder ) into a sequence of hidden vectors   H= [ h , h , ... , h]‚ààR , where dis the di-   mension of the hidden vectors . The text embedding   f(x)‚ààRis then obtained by averaging over the   Thidden vectors .   Training In the training stage , we apply an   episodic learning paradigm , which trains the model   by simulating multiple generalized zero - shot text   classification tasks on seen classes . Following the   principle that train and test conditions must match   ( Vinyals et al . , 2016 ) and recent studies on " gen-   eralized " setting ( Gidaris and Komodakis , 2018 ;   Shi et al . , 2020 ; Ye et al . , 2021 ; Bao et al . , 2020 ;   Verma et al . , 2020 ; Yu et al . , 2020 ) , the i - th episode   involves an N - way K - shot learning task for seen   classes , denoted as D={(x , y , a ) }   with Klabelled instances for each of the N   classes , which are randomly sampled from the   seen data D , and a N - way K - shot learning   task for " fake " unseen classes , denoted as D=   { ( x , y , a ) } which is also from D , with   N+N‚â§C. More precisely , let Yand   Ydenote the sampled seen class space and sam-   pled " fake " unseen class space respectively , with   Y‚äÇ Y , Y‚äÇ Y , andY‚à© Y=‚àÖ. For a   new query instance x , the generalized zero - shot   learning model performs :   ÀÜy= arg max{}p(y|x , D , D ) ( 1 )   The model has to maintain a globally consis-   tent joint class prototype space as well as dynamic   adaptation to unseen classes with zero labeled in-   stances . In this end , we design a Learn to Adapt   ( LTA ) network which first introduces a pre - trained   and learnable look - up table Sto store embeddings   of the seen prototypes , and obtain the " fake " seen   classes SfromS. The " fake " unseen prototypes519   are encoded into a matrix Uwith a BERT en-   coder using " fake " unseen class descriptions . Then   theSand the Uare concatenated and fed into a   transformer encoder layer to explicitly calibrate the   seen prototype space and unseen prototype space .   Meanwhile , a matrix of semantic components Cis   generated conditioned on the updating of the pro-   totypes . With the belief that the instance feature   space should be also calibrated according to the   prototypes in an on - the - fly manner , Cis further   used for updating the feature embedding output by   the same encoder .   3.3 Prototype adaptation   The proposed LTA network first introduces a learn-   able look - up table S‚ààRfrom which to ex-   tract the " fake " seen prototypes S‚ààR   on demand . Following Gidaris and Komodakis   ( 2018 ) ; Ye et al . ( 2021 ) ; Shi et al . ( 2020 ) , the   Sis firstly initialized by the prototypes trained   using a supervised metric learning classifier on   seen classes . The detail of the supervised met-   ric learning classifier will be described in the ex-   periment section . We claim that this initializa-   tion step will reduce the variance caused by the   sampling episode sequences . The " fake " unseen   prototypes Uis produced by the BERT encoder   f(¬∑)using their corresponding class descriptions : U= [ f(a)]‚ààR.   Then the joint prototype matrix Ris obtained by   concatenating SandU , R= [ S , U]‚ààR ,   withras the k - th prototype . Then Ris fed into a   single Transformer encoder layer ( Vaswani et al . ,   2017 ) to explicitly model the updates for both seen   prototypes and novel prototypes :   Z = TransformerEncoder ( R )   = Concat ( head , ... , head)W   where head = Softmax ( RWWR   d)RW   ( 2 )   ÀÜR = R+Z ( 3 )   where Z‚ààRhighlights the adjustment after   mutual reflections , W , W , W , W‚ààR   are trainable parameters , and the updated proto-   types ÀÜR‚ààRis regarded as the calibrated   representative prototypes of both seen and unseen   categories , with ÀÜ ras the adjusted k - th prototype .   The self - attentions used in Transformer is agile to   capture the inter - class relationship of seen and un-   seen classes and thereby it is beneficial to derive   globally discriminative prototypes . The prototype   adaptations simultaneously update both seen and   unseen classes , which enables the model to rep-   resent and discriminate the newly incoming cate-   gories in an on - the - fly manner.5203.4 Sample adaptation   As been discussed in ( Chen et al . , 2018 ) , the zero-   shot learning tasks are prone to produce semantics   loss , where some features would be discarded dur-   ing training if they are not discriminating for seen   classes , but critical for recognizing unseen classes .   We observe that the similar problem is exacerbated   in GZSL task due to the extreme unbalance be-   tween seen and unseen classes . We tackle this   problem by introducing sample adaptation follow-   ing the trajectories of prototypes adaptation . In   concrete , we apply a semantic update extractor via   attention mechanism to capture synchronous updat-   ing of the prototypes :   F = ZW ( 4 )   A = Softmax ( WReLU ( WF ) ) ( 5 )   C = AF ( 6 )   where W‚ààR , W‚ààR , W‚àà   Rare trainable parameters , Adenotes the   attention weight matrix and C‚ààRextracts   different semantic components with cas its l - th   semantic components . To offset the semantic loss   mentioned above , we use these semantic compo-   nents to guide the adaptation of sample embed-   dings . Concretely , we compare the attention score   for each hto get the most related semantic ad-   justment and reconstruct the contribution of each   word - level feature :   e = Softmax ( Œ±max(hc   ‚à•h‚à•‚à•c‚à• ) ) ( 7 )   g(x ) = Xeh ( 8)   where the self - attention weight eis used to re-   weight the t - th word of sample xto be classified ,   andŒ±is a learnable temperature scalar to control   the differentiation of Softmax scores ( Gidaris and   Komodakis , 2018 ) . In this way , the different atten-   tion weights discriminate the importance of words   rather than averaging them .   One notable reason of choosing of the above   feature - level calibration is that , in classification   task , the encoder is trained to produce feature em-   bedding that collapses to its ground - truth proto-   type , therefore the adjustment of feature embed-   ding should cater to the adjustment of a reliable   global prototype space . In addition , since this cal-   ibration is applied after the encoding , it reducesthe complicated parameter tuning for a massive   encoder ( e.g. , BERT ) , which elegantly helps the   GZSL task to fast adapt to the incoming test in-   stances .   3.5 Loss function   With the adapted prototypes ÀÜRand the adapted   sample g(x ) , a Softmax classifier is used :   p(ÀÜy = y|x ) = exp(s(g(x),ÀÜ r))Pexp(s(g(x),ÀÜ r))(9 )   where s(a , b ) = is cosine similarity with a   learnable temperature scalar Œ≥ . Finally the model is   trained by minimizing the losses across Nepisodes :   L=1   NXL ( 10 )   where Lis the loss of the i - th episode :   L=‚àí1   ( N+N)KXlogp(ÀÜy = y|x )   ( 11 )   The training process is summarized in Algorithm 1 .

We collect four   intent classification datasets . ( 1 ) SNIPS - SLU   ( Coucke et al . , 2018 ) , a widely used benchmark for   English GZSL intent detection with 5 seen intents   and 2 unseen intents . ( 2 ) SMP-18 ( Zhang et al . ,5212017 ) , a Chinese dialogue corpus for user intent   detection with 24 seen intents and 6 unseen intents .   ( 3)ATIS ( Hemphill et al . , 1990 ) , an English airline   travel domain dataset , from which we extract 17   intents with at least 5 samples , and split them into   12 seen intents and 5 unseen intents . ( 4 ) CLINC   ( Larson et al . , 2019 ) is a recently published intent   detection dataset includes 22,500 in - scope queries   covering 150 intent classes from 10 domains . We   randomly split them into 120 seen intents and 30   unseen intents .   Question Classification Dataset . In order to   draw a comprehensive analysis of the proposed   method , we construct a question classification task   from the Quora Question Pairs dataset , which is   aimed to identify duplicate questions . We collect   questions with at least 5 duplicate samples into   classes . In each class , we choose the question with   minimum words as the label description , called the   standard question , which is widely used in real-   world question - answering systems ( Sakata et al . ,   2019 ) . Table 1 summarizes all datasets statistics .   It is worth to note that intents in ATIS are highly   unbalanced with flight accounts for about 87 % of   training data .   Dataset Settings . Following ( Siddique et al . ,   2021 ) , we randomly sample seen and unseen   classes for 10 runs instead of manual selection used   in ( Yan et al . , 2020 ) , which leads to more fair re-   sults because every class could be unseen class . We   randomly take 70 % samples of each seen class as   the training set and the remaining 30 % as the seen   test , and take all the samples of unseen classes as   the unseen test . All the textual labels of the same   class are regarded as the description for this class.4.2 Baseline Methods   To validate the benefits of the proposed LTA , we   compare against with other approaches in three   aspects :   Supervised Learning Methods . To show the per-   formances on seen classes with supervised learn-   ing instead of GZSL setting , we use ( 1 ) BiLSTM   ( Schuster and Paliwal , 1997 ) and ( 2 ) BERT ( De-   vlin et al . , 2019 ) as the encoder with a linear Soft-   max classifier , which only requires samples and   one - hot label .   Metric Learning Methods . Metric - based em-   bedding methods are commonly used as baselines   for GZSL . Thus we introduce three different met-   ric learning methods : ( 1 ) EucSoftmax : We adapt   ( Snell et al . , 2017 ) that uses squared Euclidean   distance as the metric and Softmax classifies ; ( 2 )   Zero - shot DNN : We adapt ( Kumar et al . , 2017 )   that uses squared Euclidean distance and triplet   loss to maintain a margin for different classes . We   choose the label embedding ( prototype ) as the an-   chor and the closest sample as negative sample in   each triplet tuple ; ( 3 ) CosT : We adapt ( Gidaris and   Komodakis , 2018 ) which uses cosine distance as   the metric with a learnable temperature scalar .   SOTA Methods . We also compare our model   with two recent state - of - the - art ( SOTA ) methods :   ( 1)ReCapsNet ( Liu et al . , 2019 ) uses a dimen-   sional attention - based intent capsule network and a   matrix transformation method for GZSL . ( 2 ) SEG   ( Yan et al . , 2020 ) is an outlier detection approach   that can be directly applied on ReCapsNet . SEG   acts as a domain discriminator which first deter-   mines whether a test sample belongs to seen classes   or unseen classes and then classifies in their own   domain . RIDE ( Siddique et al . , 2021 ) is not con-   sidered because they use outer knowledge that is   not available in our settings , and they limit the in-   tent labels to only two components " Action " and   " Object " .   4.3 Experimental Setup   Evaluation Metrics . We basically use accuracy   ( Acc ) to estimate the performances on seen and   unseen test sets . Besides , we adopt Macro - F1 ( F1 )   rather than Micro - F1 to better evaluate the per-   formances on imbalanced and few - shot datasets ,   because Macro - F1 gives the average weight of F1   scores for each class . For overall assessments , we   adopt the widely used Harmonic Mean ( HM ) of522   Acc and F1 on seen and unseen test sets rather than   the overall metrics on the whole test set , because   the overall metrics are disturbed by the ratio of seen   and unseen test set sizes .   Implementation Details . We use the pretrained   BERT - base encoder with d= 768 on intent clas-   sification datasets and BiLSTM with d= 128   hidden vector size each direction on Quora dataset .   The scalars of our model is set to be Œ±= 10.0 , œÑ=   10.0 , d = d , which is trained via Adam ( Kingma   and Ba , 2015 ) optimizer , with learning rates 10   for BERT encoder , 10for BiLSTM encoder and   10for the other parameters . We use h= 4headsTransformer encoder layer in prototype adaptation .   During training , in order to treat seen classes and   unseen classes as equal , we set N = Nin ev-   ery meta - test set , and we set K= 5 andN=   N= [ 2,2,2,10,20],d= [ 4,16,32,64,64]for   SNIPS - NLU , SMP-18 , ATIS , CLINC and Quora   datasets , respectively .   We also conduct an ablation study to investigate   the effectiveness of each proposed component . As   depicted in Table 2 and Table 3 , " w / o Init " refers to   the model that randomly initializes Rrather than   pretrained prototypes . " w / o SA " refers to the   model that only uses prototype adaptation without   " sample adaptation " . " w / o A " means none of the   adaptation steps is applied .   4.4 Results   The results on four intent datasets and Quora   dataset are given in Table 2 and Table 3 , respec-   tively . It is observed that our proposed methods   achieve the overall best performances compared to   baselines .   Detailed and interesting observations can also be   derived from the results : ( 1 ) The metric - learning   methods as the basic baselines , achieve compa-523   rable results on Seen Test for all datasets . How-   ever , they all suffer from the domain bias problem   and the performance drops with a large margin on   Unseen Test , where the prediction is complicated   due to zero - shot scenarios . ( 2 ) The performances   on SNIPS - NLU and SMP-18 of ReCapsNet and   SEG are worse than those in their original paper   although we use the open - source codes in our ex-   periments , that is because we randomly split the   test unseen classes thus making it more challeng-   ing . Besides , these methods fail to recognize un-   seen samples well on datasets with a large scale   of categories , yielding worse 0 % Acc and F1 on   Quora . The most likely reason is that ReCapsNet   uses label embedding similarities to construct un-   seen prototypes in capsule network , which imposes   a non - trivial computational and memory burden .   ( 3 ) Our method shows its privilege for all datasets .   In particular , with the help of continuous adapting   ability , it observes a smaller gap between seen and   unseen domains , which proves the adaptation on   the testing phase effectively works . Although the   performance on seen domain drops sightly , LTA   outperforms the competitive metric - learning base-   lines by 9.54 % HM Acc and 12.90 % HM F1 av-   eragely on the whole datasets , indicating that our   model fairly balances the seen and unseen classes .   Ablation Study . To better understand the con-   tribution of each component of our method , we   explore three variants of LTA . We can observe that   LTA with both prototype adaptation and sample   adaptation outperforms those without any adapta-   tion step in all cases . The " LTA w / o Init " has   relatively stable performances . Note that " LTA w   / o SA " with only prototype adaptation achieves   worse performance compared to " LTA w / o A " on   SNIPS - NLU , SMP-18 and CLINC . It indicates that   the single prototype adaptation step may cause neg-   ative transfer , further illustrating the importance of   the sample adaptation .   4.5 Results on Emerging Unseen Classes   As the partition of seen and unseen classes is fixed   in previous experiments , to study the robustness   of the proposed adaptation method , we conduct   the experiment across unseen class sets of differ-   ent scales on CLINC dataset . Specifically , we se-   lect 70 classes as seen classes and 10 classes as   validating unseen classes . The number of testing   unseen classes is varied from 1 to 70 , which are   randomly sampled from the remaining 70 classes .   Each experiment is repeated 50 times with different   sampling sets for a more stable result . Figure 3 ( a )   shows the HM accuracy on all classes as the num-   ber of the unseen classes increases . We can see that   our LTA model outperforms the metric learning   baseline and ablation models in all cases , where   the improved performance is mainly attributed to   the improvements on unseen classes as shown in   Figure 3 ( b ) . These results suggest that our adap-   tation method is robust and effective for adapting   to increasing new classes as well as improving the   overall performance of all classes.5244.6 Visualization   To demonstrate how our adaptation method works ,   we further visualize the encoded representation   via PCA in Figure 2 . When there is no unseen   class , seen classes ( yellow and red ) is discrimina-   tive enough . But when the new class " tire change "   ( purple ) comes , it is ambiguous with class " oil   change when " ( red ) . We observe that the seen   and unseen class prototypes are updated to be far   away from each other after prototype adaptation as   shown in ( a ) , which eases the domain bias problem .   However , the performance is unsatisfactory since   the sample representations are still not discrimina-   tive no matter how the prototype updates . As we   can see , with the sample adaptation as shown in   ( b ) , the sample representations are independently   clustered by the adapted prototypes and easy to be   distinguished .   To further study how the sample adaptation   works , we select a representative case " when is   it time for a tire change " and show its atten-   tion weights used as calibration parameters in ( c ) .   The case is still misclassified after the prototype   adaptation due that the common word " time " and   " change " also appear in seen classes . After the   sample adaptation , however , it can be seen that   the word " tire " which is a keyword for classifying ,   gets the highest attention while the other confusing   words do not . This result suggests that calibrating   using attention weights helps acquire a prototype-   aware representation that guides the sample adap-   tation .   5 Conclusion   This paper proposed a novel adaptive meta - learning   network for generalized zero - shot text classifica-   tion . The model was trained under a consistent   setting with testing . In particular , it efficiently al-   leviated the bias towards seen classes by utilizing   both prototype adaptation and sample adaptation .   Experiments on five text classification datasets val-   idated that our model achieved compelling results   on both seen classes and unseen classes meanwhile   was capable of fast adapting to new classes .
