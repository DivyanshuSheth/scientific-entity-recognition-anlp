Summary:
The paper proposes a data augmentation method, called Counterfactual data Augmentation method via Perspective Transition (CAPT), to automatically augment high-quality responses with different semantics for open-domain dialogue systems. CAPT uses counterfactual inference to generate semantically different responses by intervening in the observed reply perspective. The method involves three steps: abduction, action, and prediction. Abduction estimates the unobserved variable given the observed sample. Action replaces the observed reply perspective with a substituted reply perspective using a shift graph constructed based on observed dialogues. Prediction generates counterfactual responses given the posterior sample and the known function. Experimental results show that CAPT outperforms competitive baselines on multiple downstream tasks, and the augmented data contributes to the performance improvement of retrieval-based and generation-based dialogue models. The paper also discusses the impact of the amount of augmented responses and the effectiveness of each component of CAPT. The experiments are conducted on the Chinese Weibo corpus using retrieval-based and generation-based dialogue models.
