Summary:

This research paper proposes a streaming setup for simultaneous machine translation (MT) by leveraging the streaming history. The paper introduces a state-of-the-art simultaneous sentence-level MT system and extends it to the streaming setup. The proposed system is evaluated on IWSLT Translation Tasks and shows significant quality gains when leveraging the streaming history. The paper also introduces the concept of the partial bidirectional encoder, which allows for longer context encoding in the initial positions of the streaming MT process. The evaluation metrics used include BLEU score, Average Proportion (AP), Average Lagging (AL), and Differentiable Average Lagging (DAL). The proposed system performs favorably compared to the best performing systems and achieves good translation quality while maintaining low latency. The research work is evaluated on tasks related to streaming MT, and the dataset used is the IWSLT Translation Tasks.
