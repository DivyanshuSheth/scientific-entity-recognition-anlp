Summary:

This research paper proposes quality-aware decoding for neural machine translation (NMT) by combining recent advances in reference-free and reference-based machine translation evaluation with NMT decoding methods. The paper compares various candidate generation and ranking methods using different datasets and model classes. The results show that quality-aware decoding consistently outperforms maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding according to both automatic metrics (COMET and BLEURT) and human assessments. The paper explores the impact of candidate generation methods such as beam search and sampling, as well as the impact of hyperparameters such as label smoothing. It also investigates the usefulness of reference-based and reference-free metrics for ranking and evaluation. The experiments demonstrate that quality-aware decoding leads to better translation quality than MAP-based decoding, as confirmed by both automatic metrics and human evaluations.
