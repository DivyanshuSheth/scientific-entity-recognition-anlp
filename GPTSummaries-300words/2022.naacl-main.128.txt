Summary:

This research paper presents a proposition-level pipeline for multi-document summarization (MDS). The proposed method, called ProCluster, clusters sub-sentential propositions to improve information alignment and generate representative sentences. The pipeline includes the steps of proposition extraction, salience detection, clustering, cluster ranking, and cluster fusion. ProCluster outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both automatic evaluation (ROUGE scores) and human evaluation on the DUC 2004 and TAC 2011 datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposition-level units for summarization. The paper also explores the potential of using clusters as supporting evidence for generated sentences and verifies the faithfulness of the summaries. ProCluster provides an abstractive MDS state-of-the-art approach, as well as an extractive version. The research shows the potential for further improvements in the pipeline and highlights the benefits of proposition-level units for summarization.
