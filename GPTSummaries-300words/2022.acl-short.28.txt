This research paper focuses on document-level text simplification, specifically sentence deletions. The authors propose incorporating a news genre-specific functional discourse structure, which categorizes sentences based on their content and function, into a neural network model for predicting sentence deletions. They evaluate the proposed methods on the Newsela corpus, a dataset containing English news articles with simplified versions targeting different reading levels. The baseline model is a document-level neural network with BiLSTM layers and self-attention. The authors also explore two methods for incorporating the functional structure: feature concatenation and joint learning. Experimental results show that both methods improve the recall and overall F1-score of sentence deletion prediction. The authors analyze the distribution of additional deleted sentences correctly predicted by the models and find that they are mainly context informing or supportive contents, rather than main content. The performance of the proposed models is compared to a feedforward neural network model with sparse features. The authors conclude by discussing future work, such as studying other discourse-level factors for sentence deletion prediction and investigating multi-task learning for both sentence deletion and discourse parsing tasks.
