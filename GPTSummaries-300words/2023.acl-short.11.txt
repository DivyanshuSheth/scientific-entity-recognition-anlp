Summary:

The paper proposes a Graph Propagated Data Augmentation (GPDA) framework for low-resource Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. GPDA leverages graph propagation to build relationships between labeled data and unlabeled natural texts, partially labeling the unlabeled texts for more diversity. A search engine based on Wikipedia is used to fetch related texts and propagate entity labels. The paper conducts experiments on a real-world low-resource dataset in the E-commerce domain, achieving substantial improvements over previous data augmentation methods. The evaluation metric used is F1 score. The dataset used for evaluation is CrossNER, consisting of 5 genres (AI, Literature, Music, Politics, Science) and a multilingual E-commerce query NER dataset (Ecom) in English, Spanish, and French. The paper acknowledges limitations and discusses potential risks and the impact of GPDA on different sizes of gold samples. The authors propose combining GPDA with other retrieval techniques for further enhancement. The paper also provides an ACL 2023 Responsible NLP Checklist. 

(Note: The paper does not explicitly mention the baseline and proposed system names, hyperparameters, or specific evaluation results, making it difficult to provide exact values for these details.)
