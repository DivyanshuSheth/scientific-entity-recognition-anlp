Summary:

This research paper proposes a deep active learning method for morphological processing in Arabic, specifically focusing on Egyptian Arabic. The goal is to reduce the need for annotated data, which is difficult and time-consuming to obtain for lower-resource dialects. The proposed method combines entropy-based uncertainty sampling with clustering to select informative samples for annotation. The experiments show that with only about 30% of annotated data, the proposed method achieves the same results as the state-of-the-art model trained on the entire dataset. The paper also provides an error analysis and discusses potential future research directions. The baseline system used is a transformer-based model for character-level transduction tasks. The evaluation is based on accuracy metrics, and the proposed method can be applied to other languages and dialects. The dataset used is specially created for Arabic morphophonology, focusing on Egyptian Arabic dialect. Limitations of the method include the need for GPU resources and the need for retraining the model multiple times in active learning. The authors emphasize the importance of GPU resources and the language-specific nature of the proposed method.
