Summary:

This research paper proposes a method called "Subset kNN-MT" to improve the decoding speed of k-nearest-neighbor machine translation (kNN-MT). The paper focuses on the translation task and evaluates the proposed method on the WMT'19 De-En translation task and domain adaptation tasks. The subset kNN-MT method retrieves neighbor target tokens from a subset of neighbor sentences of the input sentence, reducing the decoding time significantly. Additionally, an efficient distance computation technique using a lookup table is used for subset neighbor search. The proposed method achieves a speed-up of up to 132.2 times and an improvement in BLEU score of up to 1.6 compared to the baseline kNN-MT. The paper discusses the details of the method, hyperparameters, evaluation metrics, and datasets used in the experiments. The results demonstrate that subset kNN-MT is faster and achieves comparable translation quality to kNN-MT.
