Summary:
The paper proposes a system for automatic evaluation of counselor reflections, which aims to provide feedback to counseling trainees in real-time. The system takes a dialog turn with a client prompt and counselor response as input and outputs a numeric score indicating the quality of the reflection made by the counselor. The proposed system, called PAIR (Prompt-Aware margIn Ranking), outperforms several baselines on different metrics. The evaluation is conducted on a dataset consisting of reflections portraying different levels of reflective listening skills. The task is evaluated in a real-life educational environment. The research paper includes a detailed description of the dataset, the PAIR framework, and the evaluation results. The main contributions of the paper are the formulation of the reflection scoring problem, the development of the PAIR framework, and the quantitative and qualitative assessments of the model. The paper focuses on the task of scoring the language of counseling trainees in acquiring counseling skills. The proposed system can be used to provide useful feedback to counseling trainees.
