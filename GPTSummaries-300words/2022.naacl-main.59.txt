Summary:

This research paper proposes a novel framework, MGEN, for generating stereotypes in toxic social media posts by leveraging multiple knowledge sources. The paper categorizes three types of knowledge sources: expert knowledge, explicit knowledge obtained from knowledge graphs, and implicit knowledge obtained from large pretrained generative models. The paper evaluates the MGEN models on the SBIC dataset and the Implicit Hate Speech Corpus, comparing them against baselines such as GPT and BART models. The MGEN models outperform the baselines and generate more accurate and detailed stereotypes. The paper also presents a detailed error analysis and ablation studies on the different knowledge sources used. The limitations of the study are discussed, including the absence of human evaluation and the computational requirements of the MGEN models. The paper concludes that the MGEN models effectively synthesize the distinct knowledge sources and provide high-quality text generation, though further research is needed to address certain limitations.
