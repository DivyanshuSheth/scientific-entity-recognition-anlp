Summary:

This research paper examines the diachronic mechanisms of slang language through a causal lens. The authors analyze the semantic change and frequency shift of slang words compared to nonslang words, and study the causal effects of word type (slang/nonslang) on these dynamics. They develop a causal graphical model and perform a causal analysis using causal discovery and inference techniques. The analysis reveals that slang words undergo slower semantic change but tend to have larger frequency shifts over time compared to nonslang words. The study also provides insights into the relationship between word type and other factors such as polysemy and part of speech. The findings suggest that word type has a direct causal effect on both semantic change and frequency shift. The research focuses on the English language and uses a curated dataset of Twitter data from 2010 and 2020. The results contribute to the understanding of language change dynamics and the unique characteristics of slang language.
