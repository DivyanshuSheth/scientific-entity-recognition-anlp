Summary:

This research paper focuses on evaluating the faithfulness of abstractive summarization systems. The authors propose a framework for evaluating the effective faithfulness of summarization systems by generating a faithfulness-abstractiveness trade-off curve. They demonstrate that recent methods for improving faithfulness mostly increase extractiveness rather than improving abstraction. To address this, they propose a selector model that identifies the most abstractive and faithful summary. The proposed system achieves higher faithfulness scores while being more abstractive than the baseline system on two datasets. The authors also analyze the metrics of faithfulness and evaluate their methods on English abstractive summarization datasets, namely Gigaword and Wikihow. They demonstrate that their selector model outperforms Loss Truncation and Dependency Arc Entailment methods in terms of effective faithfulness. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of accounting for the faithfulness-abstractiveness trade-off and the need to build abstractive, faithful summarization systems.

Baseline System: Not specified

Proposed System/Method: Faithfulness-Abstractiveness Trade-off framework, Selector Model

Hyperparameters: Not mentioned

Evaluation Metrics: Faithfulness scores

Evaluation Results:
- Baseline approach and recent methods for improving faithfulness failed to consistently improve over the control at the same level of abstractiveness.
- The proposed system achieved higher faithfulness scores and better faithfulness-abstractiveness trade-off than the control.

Task: Abstractive Summarization

Dataset: Gigaword, Wikihow
