This research paper presents a method to improve the translation quality in cross - lingual scenarios by modeling the cross - lingual positional relationships using bracketing transduction grammar - based reordering information . The proposed system augments self - attention networks with cross - lingual position representations to learn bilingual diagonal alignments . The evaluation results on English⇒German , Japanese⇒English , and Chinese⇔English translation tasks demonstrate significant and consistent improvements over strong baselines . The evaluation metrics used are not mentioned in the paper . The paper focuses on machine translation tasks . The experiments are conducted on the WMT'14 , WAT'17 , and WMT'17 datasets .
