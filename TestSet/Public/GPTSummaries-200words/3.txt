This research paper presents multiple systems and methods for various tasks. The baseline and proposed systems/methods include MoCo, PPA, multilingual QE models, symbolic module, distilled attention labels, visual features integration, global entity disambiguation (ED) model based on BERT, instruction following, and semantic-aware contrastive learning. The paper mentions several hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rates, batch sizes, sequence lengths, queue size, temperature, momentum, number of epochs, and GPU memory. Evaluation metrics used in the paper include TER, F1-score, Hits@K, MRR, and macro-average F1 scores. The methods are evaluated on tasks such as Nondeterministic Substitution Ciphers, Named Entity Recognition, Argument Generation, Retrieval, Question Generation, Attention Mechanism, Sentence-level QA, Slot Filling, Task Probing, Geospatial Semantics, Environmental Sound Analysis, and NLP tasks. The datasets used include XNLI, MLQA, IA cipher, WMT'19, MuCGEC, Super Natural Instructions, and various ED datasets.
