This research paper focuses on various methods and systems for different tasks in natural language processing . The paper mentions multiple systems , such as RoBERTa , Arg - CTRL , BERT , XLM , and FPT . The hyperparameters mentioned include the number of parameters in the probing model , the context window size , and the value of k in the transformer . Evaluation metrics used include gender extractability , correctness of translation at the word level , and fairness metrics for toxicity , sentiment , and stereotype . The paper evaluates the methods on tasks such as debiasing internal representations , schema translation , controlled text generation , quality estimation for machine translation , and answering questions using knowledge graphs . Some datasets mentioned include GLUE , CRONQUESTIONS , and various datasets for fairness evaluation .
