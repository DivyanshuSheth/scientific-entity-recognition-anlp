This research paper explores the engagement of cognitive processes in storytelling by using neural language and commonsense models . The paper proposes a measure of narrative flow using generative language models , as well as quantifying semantic and episodic knowledge . The hyperparameters for the models include setting the learning rate to 1 Ã— 10^(-5 ) and training the models for 4 epochs . The evaluation metrics used are not explicitly mentioned . The paper focuses on tasks such as identifying sentences , recognizing named entities , and information extraction . The dataset used for the experiments is not specified . The paper also discusses limitations and future work .
